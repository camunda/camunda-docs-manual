You can extend the modeler to ship reusable custom tasks through custom task providers.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5">
    <img data-img-thumb src="ref:asset:/assets/img/implementation-modeler/custom-servicetask.png" />
  </div>
</div>

The following functionality is exposed to custom task providers and thus usable when implementing custom tasks:

* Add extension to properties panel
* Create task from palette
* Add custom actions to task
* Change color and icon


Head over to the custom task tutorial to learn more about [how to provide custom tasks](ref:/real-life/how-to/#modeler).
