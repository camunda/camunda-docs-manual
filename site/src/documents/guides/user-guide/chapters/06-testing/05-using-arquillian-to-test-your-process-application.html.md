title: 'Using Arquillian to test your Process Application'
category: 'Testing'

In Java EE environments we recently use JBoss Arquillian pretty often to test Process Applications, because it makes bootstrapping the engine pretty simple. We will add more documentation on this here soon - for the moment please refer to the [Arquillian Getting Started Guide](http://arquillian.org/guides/getting_started_de/).
