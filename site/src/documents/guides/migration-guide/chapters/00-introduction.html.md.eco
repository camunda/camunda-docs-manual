## Introduction

Migrating an existing application from Activiti 5.x (or camunda fox 6.x - see below) is straight forward.
This page describes the necessary steps.

**Getting Help:** If you have any trouble ask for assistance in the [Forum](http://camunda.org/community/forum.html).

The changes in short are:

* Maven **Dependencies**, e.g. `activiti.jar` changed to `camunda-engine.jar`.
* **Package Names** changed from `org.activiti` to `org.camunda.bpm` for all modules (including engine, cdi and spring).
* The **configuration file** changed from `activiti.cfg.xml` to `camunda.cfg.xml`.
* A couple of (internal) classes are renamed - see list below.

There are some things which have not changed yet:

* Database schema and table names. Note that we based our fork on Activiti 5.11 and the tables existent in this version.
* The `activiti:` [Custom Extensions](<%= @docUrl('api-references/bpmn20/') %>#!/concepts/custom-extensions) are kept. 
  A camunda BPM namespace will be introduced soon but backwards compatibility will be ensured.
