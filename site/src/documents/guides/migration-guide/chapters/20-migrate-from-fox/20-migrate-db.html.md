Be aware that there were major changes in our database structure. For migration from **camunda fox EE 6.2** and **camunda fox CE 1.34** we recommend a look at our migration scripts which are located in the following folder of your downloaded pre-packaged distribution: `$DISTRIBUTION_PATH/sql/upgrade`. To perform the migration of your database choose according to your database platform the corresponding upgrade script `$DATABASE_engine_6.2_to_7.0` and run it.
