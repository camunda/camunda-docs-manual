title: 'Creating Custom Tasks for camunda Modeler'
category: 'Modeler'

---

By providing custom tasks to the camunda Modeler vendors may provide special tasks to users through the modelers palette.
Along with these custom tasks, vendors may ship extensions to the properties panel via which task specific properties may be maintained.

![Custom task extension in action][1]

This tutorial guides you through the creation of a custom task extension for the modeler.

The source of custom task extension that is developed in this tutorial is [available as a sample application][2].


## Before You Start

In this tutorial we do a deep dive into Eclipse extension points and plug-in development.
Please refer to [exelent][3] [tutorials][4] on the matter if you would like to learn more.

Make sure you have the development environment for the camunda Modeler 
[set up][5].
This typically involves setting up the Eclipse instance with necessary dependencies, checking out the modeler sources and importing the project(s) into a workspace.


## Creating a Plug-in Project

To extend the modeler, you need to create an Eclipse plug-in project. Do so via `New > Project > Plug-in Project`.

![The new project select wizard][6]

The next steps ask you for the location of the project

![The new plugin project dialog][7]

as well vendor and versioning information.

![The new plugin project dialog][8]

You may optionally choose to generate an activator for your project to hook into the plug-ins life cycle.


## Building a Custom Task Plug-in

The modeler gives you the ability to contribute custom task types via the
`org.camunda.bpm.modeler.plugin.customtask` extension point. Via this extension point you must provide information about the custom task through the [`ICustomTaskProvider`][9] interface.


### Configure project dependencies

Add the following entry to your `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file to enable commonly used dependencies:

```
Require-Bundle: org.eclipse.emf,
 org.eclipse.core.runtime,
 org.eclipse.ui,
 org.eclipse.ui.ide,
 org.eclipse.ui.workbench,
 org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.tabbed,
 org.camunda.bpm.modeler;bundle-version="2.3.0",
 org.eclipse.bpmn2,
 org.eclipse.graphiti,
 org.eclipse.graphiti.ui
```


### Hook into the extension point

Create or edit the `plugin.xml` in your project root with the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?eclipse version="3.4"?>
<plugin>
  <extension point="org.camunda.bpm.modeler.plugin.customtask">
    <provider class="com.mycompany.modeler.tasks.MyCustomTaskProvider">
    </provider>
  </extension>
</plugin>
```

This tells Eclipse you are going to implement the custom task extension point using the class `com.mycompany.modeler.tasks.MyCustomTaskProvider`. 

You are ready to write your custom task provider. Go ahead and create the class with the following contents:

```java
public class MyCustomTaskProvider extends AbstractCustomTaskProvider {

  @Override
  public String getId() {
    return "mycompany.myCustomTask";
  }

  @Override
  public String getTaskName() {
    return PluginConstants.getMyCustomTaskName();
  }

  @Override
  public boolean appliesTo(EObject eObject) {
    return PluginConstants.isMyCustomTask(eObject);
  }
}
```

In addition, create the utility class `com.mycompany.modeler.tasks.PluginConstants` as shown below

```java
public class PluginConstants {

  public static final EStructuralFeature CLASS_STRUCTURAL_FEATURE = ModelPackage.eINSTANCE.getDocumentRoot_Class();
  
  public static final String CLASS_VALUE = "com.mycompany.services.MyService";
  
  public static boolean isMyCustomTask(EObject eObject) {
    return eObject instanceof ServiceTask && CLASS_VALUE.equals(eObject.eGet(CLASS_STRUCTURAL_FEATURE));
  }

  public static String getMyCustomTaskName() {
    return "My Custom Task";
  }
}
```

Resolve missing dependencies via `Add XXX to imported packages`. In case dependencies are unresolvable you may have problems in your build path. [Check the project requirements][10] to work around the issue.

What did we do? The class `MyCustomTaskProvider` provides the basic implementation of the custom task. It exposes the following method:

- `#getId()`: provides a unique id of the custom task
- `#getName()`: provides the task name
- `#appliesTo(EObject)`: tells the modeler whether a given [`EObject`][11] represents a custom task

The utility `PluginConstants` provides reusable utilities such as the implementation of the custom task check as well as the task name.


### Activation of the extension

The behavior shipped with a custom task provider will automatically activate whenever `ICustomTaskProvider#appliesTo(EObject)` returns true. This means, that our implementation `MyCustomTaskProvider` activates for all objects of type `ServiceTask` that have a `class` property set to `com.mycompany.services.MyService` (cf. `PluginConstants#isMyCustomTask(EObject)`). 

In other words: It is all plain old BPMN 2.0 with camunda extensions and any service task with the XML definition like

```xml
<serviceTask camunda:class="com.mycompany.services.MyService" />
```

will be recognized as a custom task once opened with the camunda Modeler and our plug-in installed.


## Adding a Property Tab

To show a special property section for a custom task we must implement the method `ICustomTaskProvider#getTabSection()`.
The method must return an instance of `ISection` that gets added to the property tabs for a task.

Add the following lines to our `MyCustomTaskProvider` class:

```java
  @Override
  public ISection getTabSection() {
    return new MyCustomTaskTabSection();
  }
```

We implement the tab section via the class `MyCustomTaskTabSection`.

```java
public class MyCustomTaskTabSection extends AbstractTabSection {

  @Override
  protected Composite createCompositeForObject(Composite parent, EObject businessObject) {
    return new MyCustomTaskTabSectionFactory(this, parent).createCompositeForBusinessObject((BaseElement) businessObject);
  }
  
  private static class MyCustomTaskTabSectionFactory extends AbstractTabCompositeFactory<BaseElement> {

    public MyCustomTaskTabSectionFactory(GFPropertySection section, Composite parent) {
      super(section, parent);
    }
    
    @Override
    public Composite createCompositeForBusinessObject(BaseElement baseElement) {

      Text endpointText = FieldInjectionUtil.createLongStringText(
        section, parent, "Endpoint", "endpoint", baseElement);
      
      PropertyUtil.attachNoteWithLink(section, endpointText, 
        "For more information search <a href=\"http://google.com\">google</a>");

      return parent;
    }
  }
}
```

The `MyCustomTaskTabSection` delegates creating the tab contents to an instance of [`AbstractTabCompositeFactory`][12].
It creates the contents of the tab in `#createCompositeForBusinessObject(EObject)`. 
Our implementation adds a text area with the label _Endpoint_ that maps to a [field injection][13] of type text with the name `endpoint`. 
In addition it renders the note `For more information search google` note right below the text.

We may now start an Eclipse with the extension installed via `Run > Run As > Eclipse Application`. 
After we assigned the class `com.mycompany.services.MyService` to a service task and refreshed the properties panel (i.e. deselect and select the task again) we should see our property tabs extension in action.

  ![Property tab extension for custom task][14]

When editing the input field labeled _Endpoint_ and saving the file, the BPMN 2.0 diagram file should reflect changes.


### Helpers available in property tabs

There are two helpers that aid you in the creation of property sections:

- [`FieldInjectionUtil`][15] offers static helpers that create input elements that map to `<camunda:field />` injection declarations.
- [`PropertyUtil`][16] offers static helpers for creating various kinds of input elements including help texts.

To learn more about what else is possible in property panels, browse subclasses of [`AbstractTabCompositeFactory`][17].


## Palette Integration

The way a custom task is integrated into the new element palette may be configured via `ICustomTaskProvider#getPaletteIntegration()`. 

To enable palette integration for our service task, add the following lines to the `MyCustomTaskProvider` class

```java
  @Override
  public IPaletteIntegration getPaletteIntegration() {
    return PaletteIntegration.intoCompartmentNamed("My Company");
  }
```

This specifies that a create handle for our custom task should be shown in a category _My Company_ in the palette. Alternatively, we may choose to integrate the task into already existing categories by returning `PaletteIntegration.intoCompartmentForCategory(Category.TASKS)`.

Now we must tell the modeler how to create the custom task.
This is done by exposing a custom set of modeling features, including a create feature via an [`IFeatureContainer`][18].


## Defining Custom Task Features

Feature containers, implementing the interface [`IFeatureContainer`][19] tell the modeler how certain modeling operations are implemented on diagram elements. 

These operations include

- creating an element
- moving, resizing or removing an element
- decorating an element

Custom tasks providers may ship their own feature containers by publishing them via `ICustomTaskProvider#getFeatureContainer()`.

You must configure a feature container in your custom task provider as soon as you want to be able create a custom task via the palette _or_ want to change its the graphical representation.


### Expose a feature container

Create the class `MyCustomTaskFeatureContainer` with the following definition

```java
public class MyCustomTaskFeatureContainer extends ServiceTaskFeatureContainer {

  @Override
  public boolean canApplyTo(Object o) {
    return o instanceof EObject && PluginConstants.isMyCustomTask((EObject) o);
  }
```

The feature container inherits the behavior provided to service tasks (extends `ServiceTaskFeatureContainer`) and applies only to instances of the custom service (cf. `MyCustomTaskFeatureContainer#canApplyTo(Object)`.

Now expose it through the custom task provider by adding the following lines to the `MyCustomTaskProvider` class:

```
  @Override
  public IFeatureContainer getFeatureContainer() {
    return new MyCustomTaskFeatureContainer();
  }
```

If you enabled the palette integration you should now see the custom service task entry in the palette as shown below

![Custom Service Task in Palette][20]


### Add a custom create feature

In order to be detected as a custom task, a newly created element must have the `class` attribute set to `com.mycompany.services.MyService`.
We can achieve this by overriding the create feature provided by the `ServiceTaskFeatureContainer` with custom behavior that explicitly sets the attribute when the task is being created.

To do so, add the following lines to the `MyCustomTaskFeatureContainer` class:

```java
  @Override
  public ICreateFeature getCreateFeature(IFeatureProvider fp) {
    String taskName = PluginConstants.getMyCustomTaskName();
    String createDescription = "A task that talks to an endpoint";
    
    return new AbstractCreateTaskFeature<ServiceTask>(fp, taskName, createDescription) {

      @Override
      protected String getStencilImageId() {
        return Images.IMG_16_SERVICE_TASK;
      }
      
      @Override
      public ServiceTask createBusinessObject(ICreateContext context) {
        ServiceTask serviceTask = super.createBusinessObject(context);
        
        serviceTask.eSet(PluginConstants.CLASS_STRUCTURAL_FEATURE, PluginConstants.CLASS_VALUE);
        
        return serviceTask;
      }
      
      @Override
      public EClass getBusinessObjectClass() {
        return Bpmn2Package.eINSTANCE.getServiceTask();
      }
    };
  }
```

Note that you can also specify the image, the task name displayed in the palette as well as a description for the create feature.

Reopening Eclipse you the palette entry should now display the name of your custom task.

![Custom Service Task in Palette][21]


## Building a Customized Modeler Distribution

As a final step we need to build a customized Eclipse that contains the camunda Modeler and our custom task plug-in.
One of the various ways to do this is via a product configuration that allows you to generate Eclipse applications as well as update sites.

To start, create a new product configuration named `customModeler.product` via `New > Other... > Plugin Configuration` and specify that you would like to create a configuration using basic settings. 

Configure the resulting view similar to the following screenshot

![Basic custom task product configuration][22]

Now add the camunda modeler as well as the custom task plug-in to the list of dependencies (_Dependencies_ tab).

![Required dependencies configuration][23]

Finally resolve the required dependencies via _Add Required Plug-ins_.

You may now start, verify and export the product configuration using the handles in the top right.


## Summary

In this how-to we created a simple custom task extension for the camunda Modeler. This involved creating a plugin project and writing a custom task extension for the camunda Modeler. Through the extension we were able to add a property panel tab as well as a palette entry for the custom task. Finally we saw how an Eclipse distribution can be build that ships the camunda Modeler including the custom task extension.


### Advanced topics

There exist a number of further topics we did not yet touch. These include

- color custom tasks on the diagram
- change the icon
- provide additional actions via the context pad
