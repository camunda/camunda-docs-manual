We use Atlassian [JIRA](https://app.camunda.com/jira) as an issue tracking system to organize our daily work. In JIRA we organize our issues in two different projects, one is for enterprise customer Support and one for the development of the camunda BPM platform. Login with your Support account to create [Support Tickets](ref:#jira-issue-tracker-support-project) (e.g. labeled as `SUPPORT-1234`) or [camunda BPM project tickets](ref:#jira-issue-tracker-camunda-bpm-project) (e.g. labeled as `CAM-5678`). In the following section you find an introduction to both projects.
