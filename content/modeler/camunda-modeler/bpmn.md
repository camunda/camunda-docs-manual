Now you can start to create a BPMN 2.0 model. Add the desired elements from the palette on the left hand side by dragging and dropping them onto the diagram canvas. Alternatively, you can add new elements by using the context menu that appears when you select an element in the diagram. Using the wrench icon in the context menu, you can change the type of an element in place.

## BPMN 2.0 Properties for Execution

In order to save your state of work, click *File / Save File As...* in the top-level menu. You can then select a location on your file system to store the diagram in the BPMN 2.0 XML format. In the future, you can load that file again by clicking *File / Open File...*.
