# Quickstart

## Create new BPMN 2.0 Diagram

To start modeling, create a new BPMN 2.0 diagram by selecting *File / New File / BPMN Diagram* in the top-level menu.

## Start Modeling

Now you can start to create a BPMN 2.0 model. Add the desired elements from the palette on the left hand side by dragging and dropping them onto the diagram canvas. Alternatively, you can add new elements by using the context menu that appears when you select an element in the diagram. Using the wrench icon in the context menu, you can change the type of an element in place.

## Demo

The Camunda Modeler covers all BPMN 2.0 elements for modeling processes and collaborations.
