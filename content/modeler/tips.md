# Tabbed Modeling

{{< img src="img/model-tabs-1.png" title="Model Tabs" >}}

It is possible to edit multiple models at the same time by using model tabs. Every new or loaded model is displayed as a tab in the tab bar at the top of the screen. By clicking on a tab, you can view the respective model.

# Eclipse Project Synchronization

If you use [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) to develop process applications, your models are typically part of an Eclipse project. With default settings, editing and saving a model in the Camunda Modeler requires manual refreshing of the project content in Eclipse. Eclipse can be configured to automatically refresh project content whenever a file changes by selecting *Window / Preferences* in the top level menu and navigate to *General / Workspace* in the preferences window. Tick the box *Refresh using native hooks or polling*.
