Cockpit allows monitoring DMN Decisions. The dashboard is the entry point to the DMN monitoring features. Select a deployed decision definition to get to the decision definition view.

All data that is displayed about decision definitions and decision instances is based on historic data. Unlike for process definitions and process instances, there is no runtime data, as decisions are executed instantly without intermediary wait states or save points.
