The process definition view provides you with information about the definition and the status of a process. On the left side you can easily survey the versions of the process and how many instances of the versions are running. Incidents of all running process instances are displayed together with an instance counter label in the corresponding rendered diagram. So it is easy to locate [failed activities][failed-activities] in the process. Use the mouse to navigate through the diagram. By turning the mouse wheel you can zoom in and out. Hold the left mouse button to pan the diagram in the desired direction. Furthermore, you can maximize the diagram view or the detailed information panel by clicking on the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-resize-full"></i></button> button, respectively the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-up"></i></button> button, at the bottom left of the diagram view.

In the `Process Instances` tab all running instances are listed in a tabular view. Besides information about start time, business key and state you can select an instance by ID and go down to the [process instance view][process-instance-view].

The `Called Process Definitions` tab displays the called child processes. In the column *Called Process Definition* the names of the called sub processes are listed. Click on the name to display the process in the process definition view. Please note that a filter called Parent is automatically set for the process so that you only see the instances that belong to the parent process. In the *Activity* column you can select the instance that is calling the child process.

The `Job Definitions` tab displays the job definitions that are linked to this process definition. Observe the name of the activity, the type of job, the configuration and the state thereof. You can also suspend and re-activate the job definition (see [Job Definition Suspension][job-definition-suspension] for more information). It is also possible to [set the priority of jobs]({{< ref "/webapps/cockpit/bpmn/process-definition-view.md#set-job-priority">}}).

# Filter

The filter function on the bottom of the Process Definition View in the `Process Instances` tab allows you to find certain instances by filtering for variables, business keys, activity IDs or date and time. In addition, you can filter for the process definition version by selecting the version of a process on the left side of the Process Definition View. Beyond that you can combine different filters as logical *AND* relation. Filter expressions on variables must be specified as `variableName OPERATOR value` where the *operator* may be one of the following terms: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `like`. Apart from the `like` operator, the operator expressions do not have to be separated by spaces.
The `like` operator is for string variables only. You can use `%` as wildcard in the *value* expression. String and date values must be properly enclosed in quotes `" "`.

Delete the current process definition version by using this feature. In the process definition view, hit the {{< glyphicon name="trash" >}} button on the right side. This opens a confirmation screen in which you can select flags to apply to the delete. You can always choose to enable/disable skipping custom listeners. However, if the process definition version has process instances running, enabling the cascading flag becomes mandatory.

# BPMN Documentation

{{< enterprise >}}
Please note that this feature is only included in the enterprise edition of the Camunda BPM platform, it is not available in the community edition.
{{< /enterprise >}}

{{< img src="../../img/cockpit-documentation.png" title="Set Job Priority" >}}

This feature allows you to inspect documentation added in the Camunda Modeler. To do so, open the Documentation tab. Elements with a documentation are indicated with a {{< glyphicon name="info-sign" >}} in the diagram. The documentation table lists all documented elements. Click on a table row to highlight the element in the diagram.

To view long documentations, click on the {{< glyphicon name="info-sign" >}} on the element or the documentation link in the table. This opens a modal which displays the formated documentation in a textbox. To copy the documentation to the clipboard, click on {{< glyphicon name="copy" >}} button.

# Set Job priority

{{< img src="../../img/cockpit-set-job-priority.png" title="Set Job Priority" >}}

You can change the job priority by overriding the priority specified in the BPMN 2.0 XML. To do so, click on the {{< glyphicon name="cog">}} icon in the `Job Definitions` tab. In the opened dialog you can override the job priority. If an overridden priority is already set, you can clear it to use the priority specified in the XML again. It is also possible to include existing jobs when changing the priority.

By using the {{< glyphicon name="cog">}} button to the right of the process diagram, you can set the job priority of all jobs contained in the process definition at once.
