Unresolved incidents of a process instance or a sub process instance are indicated by Cockpit as failed jobs. To localize which instance of a process failed, Cockpit allows you to drill down to the unresolved incident by using the process status dots. Hit a red status dot of the affected instance in the Process Definition View to get an overview of all incidents. The *Incidents* tab in the [Detailed Information Panel]({{< ref "/webapps/cockpit/bpmn/process-instance-view.md#detailed-information-panel" >}}) lists the failed activities with additional information. Furthermore, you have the possibility of going down to the failing instance of a sub process.


# Retry a Failed Job

To resolve a failed job you can use the {{< glyphicon name="repeat" >}} button on the right side. Select the corresponding instance in the confirmation dialog so the engine will re-trigger this job and increment its retry value in the database.

You can also perform a batch retry of failed jobs. This feature is available in the [process definition view]({{< ref "/webapps/cockpit/bpmn/process-definition-view.md" >}}) in the Job Definitions tab. If you hit this button, you will increment the number of retries for all of the defined jobs of the process definition.
