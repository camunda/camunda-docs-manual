Please note that we updated the frontend plugin interface with Camunda Platform Runtime 7.14. Plugins written for Camunda Platform Runtime 7.13 and earlier might no longer work with Camunda Platform Runtime 7.14. Checkout the [update guide]({{< ref "/update/minor/713-to-714" >}}) for more details.

Cockpit defines a plugin concept to add own functionality without being forced to extend or hack the Cockpit web application. You can add plugins at various plugin points, e.g., the processes dashboard as shown in the following example:

# The Nature of a Cockpit Plugin

A Cockpit plugin is a maven jar project that is included in the Cockpit webapplication as a library dependency. It provides a server-side and a client-side extension to Cockpit.

On the server-side, it can extend Cockpit with custom SQL queries and JAX-RS resource classes. Queries (defined via [MyBatis](http://www.mybatis.org/)) may be used to squeeze additional intel out of an engine database or to execute custom engine operations. JAX-RS resources on the other hand extend the Cockpit API and expose data to the client-side part of the plugin.

On the client-side a plugin may include Javascript modules to extend the Cockpit webapplication. Via those modules a plugin provides custom views.

## File structure

The basic skeleton of a Cockpit plugin looks as follows:

    cockpit-plugin/
    ├── src/
    |   ├── main/
    |   |   ├── java/
    |   |   |   └── org/my/plugin/
    |   |   |       ├── db/

    |   |   |       ├── resource/
    |   |   |       |   ├── MyPluginRootResource.java                     (3)
    |   |   |       |   └── ...                                           (4)
    |   |   |       └── MyPlugin.java                                     (1)
    |   |   └── resources/
    |   |       ├── META-INF/services/
    |   |       |   └── org.camunda.bpm.cockpit.plugin.spi.CockpitPlugin  (2)
    |   |       ├── org/my/plugin/queries/                                (6)

    |   |       └── plugin-webapp/MyPlugin/                               (7)
    |   |           └── app/
    |   |               ├── plugin.js                                     (8)
    |   |               ├── plugin.css                                    (9)
    |   |               └── ...
    |   └── test/
    |       ├── java/
    |       |   └── org/my/plugin/
    |       |       └── MyPluginTest.java
    |       └── resources/
    |           └── camunda.cfg.xml
    └── pom.xml

As runtime relevant resource it defines

1. a plugin main class
2. a `META-INF/services` entry that publishes the plugin to Cockpit
3. a plugin root [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) resource that wires the server-side API. When you want to include a frontend module in your plugin, you can use `AbstractCockpitPluginRootResource` as the plug-in resources base class. This allows you to serve static client-side resources under the `/static` path. Per convention, these resources must reside in a `/plugin-webapp/$plugin_id` directory absolute to the classpath root.
4. other resources that are part of the server-side API
5. data transfer objects used by the resources
6. mapping files that provide additional Cockpit queries as [MyBatis](http://www.mybatis.org/) mappings
7. resource directory from which client-side plugin assets are served as static files
8. a js file that exports a frontend module. This file must be named `plugin.js` and be located in the `app` directory of the plugin asset directory
9. a css file that contains the style definitions for the client-side plugin. This file must be named `plugin.css` and be located in the `app` directory of the plugin asset directory

## Structure of a Frontend Module
A frontend module always follows the same structure. This is how a sample `plugin.js` could look like:

```Javascript
export default {
  id: "customPlugin",
  pluginPoint: "cockpit.dashboard",
  priority: 5,
  render: container => {
    container.innerHTML = "Hello World!";
  }
};
```
This file can also be included standalone as a [custom script]({{< ref "/webapps/cockpit/extend/configuration.md#custom-scripts" >}}).

{{< note title="Important notes about the structure" class="info" >}}
 1. The default export is either one plugin or an array of plugins. Only the default export will be considered in Cockpit.
 2. The render function must not have a return value.
{{< /note >}}

### Attributes in Detail

* `id`: A string which defines this plugin. Should be unique across the application. This can be used to exclude plugins, see [Plugin exclusion](#plugin-exclusion-client-side).

* `pluginPoint`: A string which describes where the plugin is rendered. This also defines which parameters are passed into the render function, see the [plugin point reference](#plugin-points)

* `priority`: Number, describes in which order the plugins at the same pluginPoint will be mounted. For certain Plugin points (like `cockpit.navigation`), a negative priority hides the entry in a dropdown. How this is handled depends on the Plugin Point.

* `render`: Function, the heart of your Plugin. Arguments are (`DOMNode`|`BPMNioViewerInstance`, additionalData (`Object`)). Using the DOM node, you can render your plugin into the DOM.  
The second argument contains API endpoints and CSRF cookie information, as well as constants like a `processDefinitionId`. The `api` key is always present and contains  
  * `engine`: the engine name
  * `CSRFToken`: the current CSRF token for your requests
  * `baseApi`, `adminApi`, `cockpitApi`, `engineApi`: The paths to different API endpoints. The engineApi corresponds to the [Rest Api]({{< ref "/reference/rest" >}})
The details of which data is passed into the plugin can be found at the [plugin point reference](#plugin-points).

* `unmount`: Optional function which is called when the Plugin is unmounted. Use this to cleanup any listeners you or your Framework might have registered.

* `properties`: Optional object which contains all additional configuration for the plugin point, such as labels.

# Plugin Exclusion (Client Side)

You can exclude some plugins from the interface by adding a `cam-exclude-plugins`
attribute to the HTML `base` tag of the page loading the interface.
The content of the attribute is a comma separated list formatted like: `<plugin.key>:<feature.id>`.
If the feature ID is not provided, the whole plugin will be excluded.

## Excluding a Complete Plugin

This example will completely deactivate the action buttons on the right side of the process instance view.

```html
<base href="/"
      cam-exclude-plugins="cockpit.processInstance.runtime.action" />
```

## Excluding a Plugin Feature

In this example we deactivate the cancel action in the Cockpit process instance view and disable the job retry action button:

```html
<base href="/"
      cam-exclude-plugins="cockpit.processInstance.runtime.action:cancel-process-instance-action,
                           cockpit.processInstance.runtime.action:job-retry-action" />
```

# Legacy Plugins
Plugins created for Camunda Platform 7.13 or earlier can be included for compatibility. To achieve this, simply prefix your Plugin ID with `legacy-`. The AngularJS module name for the entry module will be `cockpit.plugin.legacy-*`.

Please note that all Plugins with this prefix will be included using the 7.13 plugin mechanism. You cannot create new Plugins with IDs starting with `legacy`.

For more details about legacy Plugins, check out the legacy [Plugin documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/webapps/cockpit/extend/plugins/). Please note that this link will take you to the documentation of Camunda Platform **7.13** .

# Plugin points

In this section you will find all Cockpit plugin points.
To configure where you place your plugin, enter the ID into the `pluginPoint` attribute of you frontend module.

Plugin Points describe where a Plugin will be rendered and define which additional data is passed into the second argument of the render function.

For more information on creating and configuring your own plugin, please see [How to develop a Cockpit plugin](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/master/cockpit/cockpit-fullstack-count-processes).

## Route
`cockpit.route`

This plugin points properties contain the attribute `path`, which stands for the hashRoute for this page. This will be rendered when the user navigates in the browser to the url, e.g. `#/my-path`.

```Javascript
properties: {
  path: "/my-path"
}
```

## Navigation

{{< img src="../../img/plugin-points/plugin-point-navigation.png" title="Navigation" >}}

**Name:** `cockpit.navigation`

This plugin point can be used in conjunction with a `cockpit.route` plugin or for shortcuts to existing pages. Negative priority will hide the entry in a drop-down.

This plugin points properties contain the attribute `path`, which matches the location to highlight the active menu entry when the user is on a certain page. The value can be a regex. If no `path` is set, the menu entry will never be highlighted.

```Javascript
properties: {
  path: "/my-path"
}
```

## Dashboard

**Name:** `cockpit.dashboard`
