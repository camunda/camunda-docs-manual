This search provides you with the possibility to search for all tasks. To use the search you can either use one of the 
predefined searches or create your own search parameters.

For a predefined search you need to click the number of one of the summary items from 'assignment by type' or 
'assignment by group'.

Furthermore, you can copy a link to the current search query to your clipboard by clicking on the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></i></button> button and you can save search queries to your local browser storage by clicking on the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-floppy-disk"></i></button> button and inserting a name in the drop down menu that appears. You can then retrieve the search query by clicking on the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-floppy-disk"></i></button> button and selecting the chosen name in the drop down menu.

You can use the links in the results to jump to the corresponding process instances. If the task isn't finished yet, the link
directs you to the runtime data of the process instance. If the task is finished, you can use the link to move to the
historic view of the process instance.
