{{< note title="Camunda discontinues the maintenance of the Camunda RPA bridge." class="warning" >}} Camunda Automation Platform 7.19 is the last release maintaining compatibility with the Camunda RPA bridge. Camunda Automation Platform 7.19 and Camunda RPA bridge will be maintained for another 18 months until Oct 2024.

The Camunda RPA Bridge is replaced by RPA [Out-of-the-box Connectors](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview/) in Camunda 8. {{< /note >}}

This page describes the steps to orchestrate and execute RPA bots from Camunda Platform using the Camunda Platform RPA Bridge.

# Requirements

## Java
Please make sure that you have the Java Runtime Environment 8+ installed.

You can verify this by using your terminal, shell, or command line:

```sh
java -version
```
If you need to install a Java Runtime Environment, you can [find the download from Oracle here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## Camunda Platform
You will need a running Camunda Platform Enterprise Edition with Camunda 7.14 or later. You can find all downloadable distros [here](https://downloads.camunda.cloud/enterprise-release/camunda-bpm/).

## Cawemo and Camunda Modeler
The easiest way to create a BPMN model that connects to an RPA bot is by using Cawemo to create a worker catalog that you can apply to your process model using the Camunda Modeler. Make sure to use Cawemo 1.4 (or later) and Camunda Modeler 4.2 (or later).

# Installation Procedure
1. Download the Camunda RPA Bridge distro from [here](https://downloads.camunda.cloud/enterprise-release/camunda-bpm/rpa/).
1. Extract the downloaded archive
1. Configure the bridge with the shipped `application.yml` file (see the [user guide]({{< ref "/user-guide/camunda-bpm-rpa-bridge.md#camunda-bpm-rpa-bridge-configuration" >}}) for a full list of configuration options).
1. Start the Bridge by executing the jar file: `java -jar camunda-bpm-rpa-bridge.jar`
1. Create and deploy a model that includes an RPA service task (see the [user guide]({{< ref "/user-guide/camunda-bpm-rpa-bridge.md#set-up-an-rpa-task" >}}) for more information) to the Camunda Platform

The bridge will now forward RPA tasks to the configured RPA vendor and publish the result back to Camunda. You can observe the process via Cockpit.
