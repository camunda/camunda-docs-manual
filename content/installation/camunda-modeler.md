## Matching Camunda Process Engine Version

For executing BPMN Diagrams created using Camunda Modeler, Process Engine version 7.4.0, 7.3.3, 7.2.6 and above is required.

Note that you do not need to install the Process Engine if you do not want to execute the BPMN Models.

# Download

Get the latest release from the [Camunda Modeler download page](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/).

Find older versions of the modeler in our [release archive](https://camunda.org/download/modeler/).

# Install

Unpack the modeler into a location of your choice.

# Run the Application

Run the application via the executable `Camunda Modeler.exe` (Windows), `Camunda Modeler.app` (Mac) or `camunda-modeler` (Linux).

# Wire File Associations

On Windows and Linux you must carry out additional steps to register the modeler as the default editor for BPMN, CMMN and DMN files.

### Windows

To make the modeler the default editor for `.bpmn`, `.cmmn` and `.dmn` files execute `support/register_fileassoc.bat`.

### Linux

To create a [desktop file](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/) and make the modeler the default editor for `.bpmn`, `.cmmn` and `.dmn` files execute `support/xdg_register.sh`.
