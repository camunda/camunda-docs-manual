Decision Model and Notation (DMN) defines a Friendly Enough Expression
Language (FEEL). It can be used to evaluate expressions in a decision table.

Camunda BPM relies on an independently maintained project to provide FEEL support. You can find the 
documentation about the **FEEL Language Reference** in the [FEEL Scala Engine Documentation][] 
(link to external documentation).

Please also check out the [User Guide] to learn more about the integration of the FEEL Scala Engine 
in Camunda BPM.
