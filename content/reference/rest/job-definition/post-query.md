Queries for job definitions that fulfill given parameters. This method is slightly more powerful than the [Get Job Definitions]({{< ref "/reference/rest/job-definition/get-query.md" >}}) method because it allows filtering by multiple job definitions of types <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code> or <code>Boolean</code>.


# Method

POST `/job-definition`


# Parameters
