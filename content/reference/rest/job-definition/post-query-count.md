Queries for the number of job definitions that fulfill given parameters. This method takes the same message body as the [Get Job Definitions (POST)]({{< ref "/reference/rest/job-definition/post-query.md" >}}) method and therefore it is slightly more powerful than the [Get Job Definition Count]({{< ref "/reference/rest/job-definition/get-query-count.md" >}}) method.


# Method

POST `/job-definition/count`


# Parameters
