Corresponds to the size of the result set when using the [Get Tasks]({{< ref "/reference/rest/task/get-query.md" >}}) method.

{{< note title="Security Consideration" class="warning" >}}
  There are several query parameters (such as `assigneeExpression`) for specifying an EL expression. These are disabled by default to prevent remote code execution. See the section on <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/securing-custom-code.md">}}">security considerations for custom code</a> in the user guide for details.
