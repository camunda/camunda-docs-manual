A signal is an event of global scope (broadcast semantics) and is delivered to all active handlers.
Internally this maps to the engine's signal event received builder method `RuntimeService#createSignalEvent()`.
For more information about the signal behavior, see the [Signal Events]({{< ref "/reference/bpmn20/events/signal-events.md" >}}) 
section of the [BPMN 2.0 Implementation Reference]({{< ref "/reference/bpmn20/_index.md" >}}).

## Request Body

A JSON object with the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>The name of the signal to deliver.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This property is mandatory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>executionId</td>
    <td>Optionally specifies a single execution which is notified by the signal.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> If no execution id is defined the signal is broadcasted to all subscribed handlers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>variables</td>
    <td>A JSON object containing variable key-value pairs. Each key is a variable name and each value a JSON variable value object.
    {{< rest-var-request transient="true">}}

  <tr>
    <td>tenantId</td>
    <td>Specifies a tenant to deliver the signal. The signal can only be received on executions or process definitions 
    which belongs to the given tenant.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Cannot be used in combination with <code>executionId</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>withoutTenantId</td>
    <td>If <code>true</code> the signal can only be received on executions or process definitions which belongs to no 
    tenant. Value may not be <code>false</code> as this is the default behavior.<br>
