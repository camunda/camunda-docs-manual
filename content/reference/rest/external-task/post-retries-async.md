Sets the number of retries left to execute external tasks by id asynchronously. If retries are set to 0, an incident is created.

POST `/external-task/retries-async`


# Parameters

## Request Body

A JSON object with the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>retries</td>
    <td>The number of retries to set for the external task.  Must be >= 0. If this is 0, an incident is created and the task cannot be fetched anymore unless the retries are increased again. Can not be null.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>externalTaskIds</td>
    <td>The ids of the external tasks to set the number of retries for.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>processInstanceIds</td>
    <td>The ids of process instances containing the tasks to set the number of retries for.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>externalTaskQuery</td>
    <td>Query for the external tasks to set the number of retries for.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>processInstanceQuery</td>
    <td>Query for the process instances containing the tasks to set the number of retries for.</td>

# Result

A JSON object corresponding to the `Batch` interface in the engine. Its
properties are as follows:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The id of the created batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The type of the created batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>totalJobs</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The total jobs of a batch is the number of batch execution jobs required to
      complete the batch.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchJobsPerSeed</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The number of batch execution jobs created per seed job invocation.
      The batch seed job is invoked until it has created all batch execution jobs required by
      the batch (see <code>totalJobs</code> property).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>invocationsPerBatchJob</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      Every batch execution job invokes the command executed by the batch
      <code>invocationsPerBatchJob</code> times. E.g., for a process instance
      migration batch this specifies the number of process instances which
      are migrated per batch execution job.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>seedJobDefinitionId</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The job definition id for the seed jobs of this batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>monitorJobDefinitionId</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The job definition id for the monitor jobs of this batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchJobDefinitionId</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The job definition id for the batch execution jobs of this batch.</td>
