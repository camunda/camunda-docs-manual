Retrieves runtime statistics of a given process definition, grouped by activities.
These statistics include the number of running activity instances, optionally the number of failed jobs and also optionally the number of incidents either grouped by incident types or for a specific incident type.<br/>
__Note:__ This does not include historic data.


# Method

GET `/process-definition/{id}/statistics`

GET `/process-definition/key/{key}/statistics` (returns statistics for the latest version of the process definition which belongs to no tenant)

GET `/process-definition/key/{key}/tenant-id/{tenant-id}/statistics` (returns statistics for the latest version of process definition for tenant)

# Parameters

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>key</td>
    <td>The key of the process definition (the latest version thereof) to be retrieved.</td>

## Query Parameters

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>failedJobs</td>
    <td>Whether to include the number of failed jobs in the result or not. Valid values are <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>incidents</td>
    <td>Valid values for this property are <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If this property has been set to <code>true</code> the result will include the corresponding number of incidents for each occurred incident type. If it is set to <code>false</code>, the incidents will not be included in the result.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>incidentsForType</td>
    <td>If this property has been set with any incident type (i.e., a String value) the result will only include the number of incidents for the assigned incident type. See the <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/incidents.md#incident-types" >}}">User Guide</a> for a list of incident types.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

__Note:__ The query parameters `incidents` and `incidentsForType` are exclusive. It is not possible to send a request with both query parameters. In that case the response will be a bad request.

# Result

A JSON array containing statistics results per activity.
Each object has the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The id of the activity the results are aggregated for.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>instances</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>The total number of running instances of this activity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>failedJobs</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>The total number of failed jobs for the running instances.<br/>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Will be <code>0</code> (not <code>null</code>), if failed jobs were excluded.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>incidents</td>
    <td>Array</td>
    <td>Each item in the resulting array is an object which contains the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>incidentType: The type of the incident the number of incidents is aggregated for. See the <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/incidents.md#incident-types" >}}">User Guide</a> for a list of incident types.</li>
          <li>incidentCount: The total number of incidents for the corresponding incident type.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Will be an empty array, if <code>incidents</code> or <code>incidentsForType</code> were excluded. Furthermore, the array will be also empty if no incidents were found.
