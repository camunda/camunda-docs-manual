Queries for the number of historic external task logs that fulfill the given parameters.
This method takes the same message body as the [Get External Task Logs (POST)]({{< ref "/reference/rest/history/external-task-log/post-external-task-log-query.md" >}}) method and therefore it is slightly more powerful than the [Get External Task Log Count]({{< ref "/reference/rest/history/external-task-log/get-external-task-log-query-count.md" >}}) method.
