Query for the number of historic job logs that fulfill the given parameters.
This method takes the same message body as the [POST query](ref:#history-get-job-logs-post)
and therefore it is slightly more powerful than the [GET query count](ref:#history-get-job-logs-count).


Method
------

POST `/history/job-log/count`
