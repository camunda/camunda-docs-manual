    <td>historicDecisionInstanceIds</td>
    <td>A list historic decision instance ids to delete.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>historicDecisionInstanceQuery</td>
    <td>
      A historic decision instance query like the request body described by
      <a href="{{< ref "/reference/rest/history/decision-instance/get-decision-instance-query.md#query-parameters" >}}">
        <code>POST /history/decision-instance</code>
      </a>.

  <tr>
    <td>deleteReason</td>
    <td>A string with delete reason.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>batchJobsPerSeed</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The number of batch execution jobs created per seed job invocation.

    <td>invocationsPerBatchJob</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      Every batch execution job invokes the command executed by the batch
      <code>invocationsPerBatchJob</code> times. E.g., for a decision instance
      deletion batch this specifies the number of decision instances which
      are deleted per batch execution job.
