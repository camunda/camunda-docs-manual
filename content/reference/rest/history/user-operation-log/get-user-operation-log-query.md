Queries for user operation log entries that fulfill the given parameters.
The size of the result set can be retrieved by using the [Get User Operation Log Count]({{< ref "/reference/rest/history/user-operation-log/get-user-operation-log-query-count.md" >}}) method.

Note that the properties of operation log entries are interpreted as restrictions on the entities they apply to. That means, if a single process instance is updated, the field `processInstanceId` is populated. If a single operation updates all process instances of the same process definition, the field `processInstanceId` is `null` (a `null` restriction is viewed as a wildcard, i.e., matches a process instance with any id) and the field `processDefinitionId` is populated. This way, which entities were changed by a user operation can easily be reconstructed.
