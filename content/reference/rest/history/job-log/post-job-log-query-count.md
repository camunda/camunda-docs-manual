Queries for the number of historic job logs that fulfill the given parameters.
This method takes the same message body as the [Get Job Logs (POST)]({{< ref "/reference/rest/history/job-log/post-job-log-query.md" >}}) method and therefore it is slightly more powerful than the [Get Job Log Count]({{< ref "/reference/rest/history/job-log/get-job-log-query-count.md" >}}) method.


# Method

POST `/history/job-log/count`
