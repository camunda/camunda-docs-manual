    <td>processInstanceQuery</td>
    <td>
      A process instance query like the request body described by

A JSON object corresponding to the `Batch` interface in the engine. Its properties are as follows:

    <td>type</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The type of the batch. See the <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/batch.md#creating-a-batch" >}}">User Guide</a> for more information about batch types.</td>

      <code>invocationsPerBatchJob</code> times. E.g., for a process instance
      migration batch this specifies the number of process instances which
      are migrated per batch execution job.
