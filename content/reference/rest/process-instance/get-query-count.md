    <strong>Note:</strong> Values are always treated as <code>String</code> objects on server side.<br/>
    <br/>
    Valid operator values are: <code>eq</code> - equal to; <code>neq</code> - not equal to; <code>gt</code> - greater than;
    <code>gteq</code> - greater than or equal to; <code>lt</code> - lower than; <code>lteq</code> - lower than or equal to;
    <code>like</code>.<br/>
    <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> may not contain underscore or comma characters.
