Create a batch to set retries of jobs associated with given processes asynchronously.

# Method

POST `/process-instance/job-retries`


# Parameters

## Request Body

A JSON object with the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>processInstances</td>
    <td>A list process instance ids to fetch jobs for which retries will be set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>processInstanceQuery</td>
    <td>
      A process instance query like the request body described by
      <a href="{{< relref "reference/rest/process-instance/post-query.md#request-body" >}}">
        <code>POST /process-instance</code>
      </a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>retries</td>
    <td>An integer representing number of retries. Please note that it cannot be negative or null.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Please note that if both processInstances and processInstanceQuery are provided then resulting execution
will performed on union of this sets.

## Response Body

A JSON object corresponding to the Batch interface in the engine. Its properties are as follows:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The id of the batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The type of the batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>totalJobs</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The total jobs of a batch is the number of batch execution jobs required to
      complete the batch.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>jobsCreated</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The number of batch execution jobs already created by the seed job.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchJobsPerSeed</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The number of batch execution jobs created per seed job invocation.
      The batch seed job is invoked until it created all batch execution jobs required by
      the batch (see <code>totalJobs</code> property).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>invocationsPerBatchJob</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      Every batch execution job invokes the command executed by the batch
      <code>invocationsPerBatchJob</code> times. E.g., for a process instance
      migration batch this specifies the number of process instances which
      are migrated per batch execution job.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>seedJobDefinitionId</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The job definition id for the seed jobs of this batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchJobDefinitionId</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The job definition id for the batch execution jobs of this batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>suspended</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>Indicates wheter this batch is suspened or not.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
