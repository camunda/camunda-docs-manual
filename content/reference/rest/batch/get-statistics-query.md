Queries for batch statistics that fulfill given parameters. Parameters may be the

# Method

GET `/batch/statistics`


# Parameters

## Query Parameters

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchId</td>
    <td>Filter by batch id.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>Filter by batch type. See the <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/batch.md#creating-a-batch" >}}">User Guide</a> for more information about batch types.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tenantIdIn</td>
    <td>Filter by a comma-separated list of tenant ids. A batch matches if it has one of the given tenant ids.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>withoutTenantId</td>
    <td>Only include batches which belong to no tenant. Value can effectively only be <code>true</code>, as <code>false</code> is the default behavior.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>suspended</td>
    <td>
      A <code>Boolean</code> value which indicates whether only active or
      suspended batches should be included. When the value is set to
      <code>true</code>, only suspended batches will be returned and when the
      value is set to <code>false</code>, only active batches will be returned.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sortBy</td>
    <td>
      Sort the results lexicographically by a given criterion.
      Valid values are <code>batchId</code> and <code>tenantId</code>.
      Must be used in conjunction with the <code>sortOrder</code> parameter.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sortOrder</td>
    <td>Sort the results in a given order. Values may be <code>asc</code> for ascending order or <code>desc</code> for descending order.
    Must be used in conjunction with the <code>sortBy</code> parameter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>firstResult</td>
    <td>Pagination of results. Specifies the index of the first result to return.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>maxResults</td>
    <td>Pagination of results. Specifies the maximum number of results to return. Will return less results if there are no more results left.</td>
  </tr>

# Result

A JSON array of batch statistics objects.
Each batch statistics object has the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>

    <td>The type of the batch. See the <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/batch.md#creating-a-batch" >}}">User Guide</a> for more information about batch types.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>totalJobs</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The total jobs of a batch is the number of batch execution jobs required to
      complete the batch.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>jobsCreated</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The number of batch execution jobs already created by the seed job.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchJobsPerSeed</td>
    <td>Number</td>

      the batch (see <code>totalJobs</code> property).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>invocationsPerBatchJob</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      Every batch execution job invokes the command executed by the batch
      <code>invocationsPerBatchJob</code> times. E.g., for a process instance
      migration batch this specifies the number of process instances which
      are migrated per batch execution job.
