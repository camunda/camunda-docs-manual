# Method

POST `/job/retries`


# Parameters

## Request Body

A JSON object with the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>jobIds</td>
    <td>A list of job ids to set retries for.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>jobQuery</td>
    <td>
      A job query like the request body for the 
      <a href="{{< ref "/reference/rest/job/post-query.md#request-body" >}}">
        Get Jobs (POST)
      </a> method.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>retries</td>
    <td>An integer representing the number of retries. Please note that the value cannot be negative or null.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Please note that if both jobIds and jobQuery are provided, then retries will be set on the union
of these sets. 

## Response Body

A JSON object corresponding to the Batch interface in the engine. Its properties are as follows:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The id of the batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The type of the batch. See the <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/batch.md#creating-a-batch" >}}">User Guide</a> for more information about batch types.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>totalJobs</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The total jobs of a batch is the number of batch execution jobs required to
      complete the batch.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>jobsCreated</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The number of batch execution jobs already created by the seed job.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchJobsPerSeed</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      The number of batch execution jobs created per seed job invocation.
      The batch seed job is invoked until it has created all batch execution jobs required by 
      the batch (see <code>totalJobs</code> property).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>invocationsPerBatchJob</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>
      Every batch execution job invokes the command executed by the batch
      <code>invocationsPerBatchJob</code> times. E.g., for a process instance
      migration batch this specifies the number of process instances which
      are migrated per batch execution job.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>seedJobDefinitionId</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The job definition id for the seed jobs of this batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>batchJobDefinitionId</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>The job definition id for the batch execution jobs of this batch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>suspended</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>Indicates whether this batch is suspended or not.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tenantId</td>
