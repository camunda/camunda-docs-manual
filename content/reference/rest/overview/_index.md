The goal of the REST API is to provide access to all relevant interfaces of the engine.


# Structure

These documents explain all existing methods in the REST API. For each method they provide:

* An informal description
* HTTP verb and URL
* Possible query, path or message body parameters
* A detailed description of the response content
* Possible response codes
* A brief example request and response


# Engine Usage

The methods as described work on the default process engine as given by the available `ProcessEngineProvider` service.

You may prepend `/engine/{name}` to any of the methods (unless otherwise documented) to access another engine where `{name}` is the name of the process engine as returned by `ProcessEngine#getName()`, e.g., `/engine/myEngineName/task`.


# Error Handling

For every method this documentation gives possible HTTP status codes. The error code explanations do not cover all possible error causes that may arise when the request is served, for example, most of the requests will not work properly if there are problems with database access. Any of these undocumented errors will be translated to a HTTP 500 error.

All errors also provide a JSON response body of the form:

```json
  {
    "type" : "SomeExceptionClass",
    "message" : "a detailed message"
  }
```

## Authorization Exceptions

If an already authenticated user interacts with a resource in an unauthorized way, the status code of the response will be set to `403 Forbidden`. Details about the unauthorized interaction are provided in the response body.

#### Type

`AuthorizationException`

#### Response Body

```json
{"type" : "AuthorizationException",
 "message" : "The user with id 'jonny' does not have 'DELETE' permission on resource 'Mary' of type 'User'.",
 "userId" : "jonny",
 "permissionName" : "DELETE",
 "resourceName" : "User",
 "resourceId" : "Mary"}
```

## Migration Validation Exceptions

If a migration plan from one process definition version to another is not
valid, a migration exception is thrown. It can be a *migration plan validation
exception* where the plan itself is not valid, e.g., it contains an invalid
instruction. Or it can be a *migrating process instance validation exception* when a
migration plan cannot be applied to a specific process instance, e.g., an active
activity was not mapped by the migration plan.

### Migration Plan Validation Exceptions

#### Type

`MigrationPlanValidationException`

#### Response Body

A JSON object with the following properties:

    <td>
      A JSON array describing a single instruction validation report.
      Each report object consists of an <code>instruction</code> that is
      invalid and a <code>failures</code> array containing the validation
      messages for this instruction.

## Parse Exceptions

If the process bpmn resource cannot be parsed during deployment, the deployment of it will fail and the status code of the response will be set to `400 Bad Request`. Details about the parsing problems are provided in the response body.

#### Type

`ParseException`

#### Response Body

```json
{
	"type": "ParseException",
	"message": "ENGINE-09005 Could not parse BPMN process. Errors: Exclusive Gateway 'ExclusiveGateway_1' has outgoing sequence flow 'SequenceFlow_0' without condition which is not the default flow.",
	"details": {

			"errors": [
				{
					"message": "Exclusive Gateway 'ExclusiveGateway_1' has outgoing sequence flow 'SequenceFlow_0' without condition which is not the default flow.",
					"line": 77,

						"ExclusiveGateway_1",
						"SequenceFlow_0"

					"bpmnElementIds": [
						"BoundaryEvent_1"

		}
	}
```

## Query Maximum Results Limit Exceptions

When the [maximum results limit of a query]({{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-api.md#query-maximum-results-limit">}})
is exceeded, an exception is thrown which results in an HTTP status code 400.

# Authentication

The REST API ships with an implementation of [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). By default it is switched off (in the rest-api web application and therefore also in the pre-built Camunda BPM distributions). You can activate it by adding a servlet filter as described in the [Authentication]({{< ref "/reference/rest/overview/authentication.md" >}}) section.
