The REST API is an artifact of its own, which means that it can be embedded in any other JAX-RS application independently of the engine.

# Prerequisites

The REST API classes are tested with [RESTEasy](http://www.jboss.org/resteasy/), [Jersey](http://jersey.java.net/) and [Wink](http://wink.apache.org/) as the JAX-RS implementation.
Furthermore, the engine classes and Jackson's `com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs:jackson-jaxrs-json-provider` artifact (as well as transitive Jackson dependencies) have to be on the classpath.


# Required Steps

**Step 1:** Add the REST API to your project as a Maven dependency.

{{< note title="" class="info" >}}
  Please import the [Camunda BOM](/get-started/apache-maven/) to ensure correct versions for every Camunda project.
{{< /note >}}

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-engine-rest</artifactId>
  <classifier>classes</classifier>
</dependency>
```

**Step 2:** Add the REST resources that you need to your JAX-RS application. Example:

```java
@ApplicationPath("/")
public class MyApplication extends Application {
  @Override
  public Set<Class<?>> getClasses() {
    Set<Class<?>> classes = new HashSet<Class<?>>();
    // add your own classes
    ...
    // add all camunda engine rest resources (or just add those that you actually need).
    classes.addAll(CamundaRestResources.getResourceClasses());

    // mandatory
    classes.addAll(CamundaRestResources.getConfigurationClasses());

    return classes;
  }
}
```

`CamundaRestResources.getResourceClasses()` contains two JAX-RS resources that serve as the entry points. One of these (`org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.impl.NamedProcessEngineRestServiceImpl`) provides all of the REST resources listed in this document on paths beginning with `/engine/{name}` while the other (`org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.impl.DefaultProcessEngineRestServiceImpl`) provides access to the default engine's resources on the root path `/`.

To restrict the exposed REST resources to specific types (e.g., only process-definition-related methods), a subclass of `org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.impl.AbstractProcessEngineRestServiceImpl` can be implemented and registered with the JAX-RS application. Such a subclass can control which resources get exposed by offering JAX-RS-annotated methods. See the sources of `NamedProcessEngineRestServiceImpl` and `DefaultProcessEngineRestServiceImpl` for an example. **Note**: The path to a subresource should always match the path defined in the subresource's interface.

The configuration class `JacksonConfigurator` is required to correctly configure the serialization of date fields.
You may also have to add the following Jackson providers: `com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.json.JacksonJsonProvider`,
`org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.exception.JsonMappingExceptionHandler` and `org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.exception.JsonParseExceptionHandler`.
Depending on the runtime environment, this may not be necessary.
On JBoss AS 7/Wildfly these should be automatically added as an implicit module dependency.

For proper exception responses of the format as described in the [Introduction]({{< ref "/reference/rest/overview/_index.md" >}}),
it is necessary to include `RestExceptionHandler`. `ProcessEngineExceptionHandler` is used to translate any exception thrown by the
engine that is not explicitly handled by the REST API classes to a generic HTTP 500 error with the same response body format.
If you would like to have all kinds of exceptions translated to this format, you can use `org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.exception.ExceptionHandler` instead of `ProcessEngineExceptionHandler`.

Next is the wiring of the REST API and the process engine(s).
To do this, you must create a Service Provider that implements the interface `ProcessEngineProvider`
and declare it in a file `META-INF/services/org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.spi.ProcessEngineProvider`.
You may also declare the class `org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.impl.application.ContainerManagedProcessEngineProvider`
which comes with the REST API and uses the methods that the class `org.camunda.bpm.BpmPlatform` provides.
