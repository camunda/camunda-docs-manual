The REST API ships with an implementation of [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). By default it is switched off, but can be activated by adding a servlet filter as follows:

```xml
<filter>
  <filter-name>camunda-auth</filter-name>
  <filter-class>
    org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.security.auth.ProcessEngineAuthenticationFilter
  </filter-class>
  <async-supported>true</async-supported>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>authentication-provider</param-name>
    <param-value>org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.security.auth.impl.HttpBasicAuthenticationProvider</param-value>
  </init-param>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>camunda-auth</filter-name>
  <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

Any engine-specific request will then be authenticated against that engine's identity service. The GET `/engine` request that supplies a list of all available process engines is the only request that does not require authentication. Any request that does not address a specific engine (i.e., it is not of the form `/engine/{name}/...`) will be authenticated against the default engine.

In the pre-built distributions, the engine authentication is switched off by default. You may have a look at the distribution's `web.xml` file and remove the comment markers from the above mentioned filter declaration to activate authentication.

Note that HTTP Basic Authentication *does not provide encryption* and should be secured by an SSL connection.

The authentication provider is exchangeable. You can implement the interface `org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.security.auth.AuthenticationProvider` to provide another authentication method and change the filter's initialization parameter accordingly.

# RESTEasy Specifics

The authentication filter works fine whenever the JAX-RS application containing the REST API is deployed as a servlet. This is not necessarily the case. One such case we are aware of is with some types of RESTEasy deployments:

RESTEasy allows deployment of a JAX-RS application as a servlet filter (see the [RESTEasy docs](http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/2.3.5.Final/userguide/html/Installation_Configuration.html#filter)). If you choose this method to deploy the REST API application, which we also do in the Tomcat distribution, the authentication filter requires an extra init-param named `rest-url-pattern-prefix`. The value has to correspond to the servlet path (see [HttpServletRequest#getServletPath()](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getServletPath%28%29)) as in the case that the JAX-RS application is deployed as a servlet.

Example: If the RESTEasy configuration is

```xml
<filter>
  <filter-name>Resteasy</filter-name>
  <filter-class>
      org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.FilterDispatcher
  </filter-class>
  <init-param>
      <param-name>javax.ws.rs.Application</param-name>
      <param-value>org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.impl.application.DefaultApplication</param-value>
  </init-param>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>Resteasy</filter-name>
  <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

the following init-param has to be set:

```xml
<init-param>
  <param-name>rest-url-pattern-prefix</param-name>
  <param-value></param-value>
</init-param>
```

In the example above the value is empty because the RESTEasy filter mapping is `/\*` and a servlet with that mapping would have an empty servlet path. Similarly, the filter mapping url `/rest/\*` maps to the init-param `/rest` and so on.
