Correlates a message to the process engine to either trigger a message start event or an intermediate message catching event.
Internally this maps to the engine's message correlation builder methods `MessageCorrelationBuilder#correlateWithResult()` and `MessageCorrelationBuilder#correlateAllWithResult()`.
For more information about the correlation behavior, see the [Message Events]({{< ref "/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events.md" >}}) section of the [BPMN 2.0 Implementation Reference]({{< ref "/reference/bpmn20/_index.md" >}}).


# Method

POST `/message`

# Parameters

## Request Body

A JSON object with the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>messageName</td>
    <td>The name of the message to deliver.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>businessKey</td>
    <td>Used for correlation of process instances that wait for incoming messages. Will only correlate to executions that belong to a process instance with the provided business key.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tenantId</td>
    <td>Used to correlate the message for a tenant with the given id. Will only correlate to executions and process definitions which belong to the tenant.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>withoutTenantId</td>
    <td>A Boolean value that indicates whether the message should only be correlated to executions and process definitions which belong to no tenant or not. Value may only be <code>true</code>, as <code>false</code> is the default behavior.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>processInstanceId</td>
    <td>Used to correlate the message to the process instance with the given id. Must not be supplied in conjunction with a <code>tenantId</code>. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>correlationKeys</td>
    <td>Used for correlation of process instances that wait for incoming messages.
    Has to be a JSON object containing key-value pairs that are matched against process instance variables during correlation.
    Each key is a variable name and each value a JSON variable value object with the following properties.
    {{< rest-var-request-primitive-only >}}
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Process instance variables are the global variables of a process instance.
    Local variables of child executions (such as in subprocesses) are not considered!</p></td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>localCorrelationKeys</td>
      <td>Local variables used for correlation of executions (process instances) that wait for incoming messages.
      Has to be a JSON object containing key-value pairs that are matched against local variables during correlation.
      Each key is a variable name and each value a JSON variable value object with the following properties.
      {{< rest-var-request-primitive-only >}}
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only variable values that are defined in the execution scope are taken into account,
       without taking outer (parent) scopes.</p></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>processVariables</td>
    <td>A map of variables that is injected into the triggered execution or process instance after the message has been delivered.
    Each key is a variable name and each value a JSON variable value object with the following properties.
    {{< rest-var-request transient="true">}}
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>processVariablesLocal</td>
    <td>A map of local variables that is injected into the triggered execution or process instance after the message has been delivered.
    Each key is a variable name and each value a JSON variable value object with the following properties.
    {{< rest-var-request transient="true">}}
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>all</td>
    <td>A Boolean value that indicates whether the message should be correlated to exactly one entity or multiple entities. If the value is set to <code>false</code>, the message will be correlated to exactly one entity (execution or process definition). If the value is set to <code>true</code>, the message will be correlated to multiple executions and a process definition that can be instantiated by this message in one go.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>resultEnabled</td>
    <td>A Boolean value that indicates whether the result of the correlation should be returned or not. If this property is set to <code>true</code>, there will be returned a list of message correlation result objects.
    Depending on the <code>all</code> property, there will be either one ore more returned results in the list.
    <p>The default value is <code>false</code>, which means no result will be returned.</p>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>variablesInResultEnabled</td>
    <td>A Boolean value that indicates whether the result of the correlation should contain process variables or not. The parameter  <code>resultEnabled</code> should be set to <code>true</code> in order to use this it.
    <p>The default value is <code>false</code>, which means the variables will not be returned.</p>
  </tr>
</table>


# Result

This method returns no content if the property `resultEnabled` is set to <code>false</code>, which is the default value.
Otherwise, a JSON array of the message correlation results will be returned. Each message correlation result has the following properties:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>resultType</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>
      Indicates if the message was correlated to a message start event or an intermediate message catching event.
      In the first case, the resultType is <code>ProcessDefinition</code> and otherwise <code>Execution</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>processInstance</td>
   <td>Object</td>
   <td>
    This property only has a value if the resultType is set to <code>ProcessDefinition</code>.
    The processInstance with the properties as described in the <a href="{{< ref "/reference/rest/process-instance/get.md" >}}">get single instance</a> method.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>execution</td>
   <td>Object</td>
   <td>
    This property only has a value if the resultType is set to <code>Execution</code>.
    The execution with the properties as described in the <a href="{{< ref "/reference/rest/execution/get.md" >}}">get single execution</a> method.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>variables</td>
   <td>List</td>
   <td>
    This property is returned if the <code>variablesInResultEnabled</code> is set to <code>true</code>.
    Contains a list of the process variables.
   </td>
  </tr>
