{{< note class="info" title="Support for Camunda Forms" >}}
The Camunda Forms feature was added with the 7.15.0 release of Camunda Platform and the 4.7.0 release of the Camunda Modeler.
{{< /note >}}


Camunda Forms allow you to easily design and configure forms and then embed them in the Camunda Tasklist.

* Camunda Forms are created in the Camunda Modeler. You can find out how in the [Camunda Modeler documentation]({{< ref "/modeler/forms.md" >}}).
* Camunda Forms can easily be embedded in the Camunda Tasklist. You can find out how in the [User Task Forms guide]({{< ref "/user-guide/task-forms/_index.md#camunda-forms" >}}).
* Camunda Forms are powered by the open source [bpmn-io form-js library](https://github.com/bpmn-io/form-js). Visit the [open source repository](https://github.com/bpmn-io/form-js) to find out how to render a form using plain JavaScript in a custom application (note that this also requires you to to fetch the form from the respective BPMN 2.0 element and provide data as needed to the form).

# Mapping components to Process Variables

Each Camunda Forms component which allows data manipulation has a **Key** attribute. This attribute is used as an identifier to map data of the respective field (1) during initial loading of the form, and (2) during submission of the form.

When a form is [referenced by a User Task or Start Event]({{< ref "/user-guide/task-forms/_index.md#camunda-forms" >}}) and viewed in the [Camunda Tasklist]({{< ref "/webapps/tasklist/_index.md" >}}), the key will be used to refer to a [Process Variable]({{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/variables.md" >}}). This means that the value of the Process Variable will be used to populate the respective component initially and that the value of the component will be saved in the Process Variable during submission of the form.
