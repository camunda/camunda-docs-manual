The camunda-engine-cdi module provides programming model integration with CDI (Context and Dependency Injection). CDI is the Java EE 6 standard for Dependency Injection. The camunda-engine-cdi integration leverages both the configuration of the Camunda engine and the extensibility of CDI. The most prominent features are:

 * A custom El-Resolver for resolving CDI beans (including EJBs) from the process,
 * Support for @BusinessProcessScoped beans (CDI beans, the lifecycle of which are bound to a process instance),
 * Declarative control over a process instance using annotations,
 * The Process Engine is hooked-up to the CDI event bus,
 * Works with both Java EE and Java SE,
 * Support for unit testing.

Since Quarkus ArC does not aim to fully implement CDI 2.0, you cannot use the full range of features the `camunda-engine-cdi` module provides.
Read about the limitations in the [Quarkus Integration]({{< ref "/user-guide/quarkus-integration/cdi-integration.md#limitations" >}}) guide.
