Some Camunda Platform features (e.g. enterprise plugins) require a license key. The license will be provided as a string by 
the Camunda support team. The license mechanism has no impact on the engine or other runtime components. The following 
section explains the various methods by which a Camunda license can be added to the Process Engine.


# Deployment Scenarios and the License Key

A Camunda license key should be applied per database.

In a clustered scenario, where multiple engines on multiple nodes access a single database, the 
license only needs to be activated once. When activated, a license is valid until the expiration 
date or until you have deleted your database. The license key is valid for an unlimited amount of 
engines.

In a multi tenancy scenario, the license check will be performed for each engine with an own 
database. Thus, you will be prompted to enter the license key separately for each engine.


# License Key Pickup Methods

## Through the Admin Webapp UI

Any environment setup that uses the enterprise Camunda Admin webapp, can use the provided License key page to
enter a valid license key. Please see the dedicated [Admin webapp]({{< ref "/webapps/admin/system-management.md#camunda-license-key" >}}) 
docs section for more details.

## Through the Java API

This method can be used in any environment setup. The license key can be set via the 
Java API by calling:

```
managementService.setLicenseKey(String licenseKey);
```

The managementService also offers methods to get and delete the license key from the database.
The license key is stored in the `ACT_GE_BYTEARRAY` table. A reference to the license entry can 
be found in the `ACT_GE_PROPERTY` table (`camunda-license-key-id`).

## Through the Home Directory

Another possibility is to put a file with the license key on the path `${user.home}/.camunda/license.txt`. 
This is another method that can be applied in any environment setup. The license key will be 
automatically loaded in the database table unless a valid license key is already present.

## With the Camunda Spring Boot Starter & Camunda Run

Camunda Run, and other Spring Boot applications (including Camunda Platform RPA Bridge) that use the 
Camunda Spring Boot Starter, can be provided with license  keys in two additional ways:

* provide a URL to a license file via a custom [Spring Property]({{< ref "/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/configuration.md#license-file" >}}).
* provide the license key in a file called `camunda-license.txt` which is on the classpath of the application.

**Note:** For these two properties to be available, the Camunda Run EE edition must be used, or the Spring Boot 
application must use the **`camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter-webapp-ee`** module.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter-webapp-ee</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# License compatibility

There are two different types of licenses for Camunda Platform. While the original format is only valid 
for Camunda Platform, the second format can be valid for multiple Camunda products (like Camunda Platform, 
Cawemo or Optimize). Such unified licenses are supported from the versions listed below onwards. 
Since 7.12.0 all versions (including major/minor releases) support unified license keys.

# License content

This section defines what is a valid license key that will be accepted by the Process Engine. This description is 
valid for all [License pickup methods](#license-key-pickup-methods).

A valid license key content should include the following:

1. The header section:
    ```
    --------------- BEGIN CAMUNDA BPM LICENSE KEY ---------------
    ``` 
1. The encrypted license key.

1. The unencrypted customer, expiry date and product data.

1. The footer section:
    ```
    ---------------  END CAMUNDA BPM LICENSE KEY  ---------------
    ```

Note that omitting one of these sections will result in an error, and you will have to re-enter your
license key in the correct format.
