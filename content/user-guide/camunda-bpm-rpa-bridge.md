{{< note title="Camunda discontinues the maintenance of the Camunda RPA bridge." class="warning" >}}
Camunda Automation Platform 7.19 is the last release maintaining compatibility with the Camunda RPA bridge. Camunda Automation Platform 7.19 and Camunda RPA bridge will be maintained for another 18 months until Oct 2024.

The Camunda RPA Bridge is replaced by RPA [Out-of-the-box Connectors](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview/) in Camunda 8.
{{< /note >}}

The Camunda RPA Bridge is a standalone application that allows calling RPA (robotic process automation) bots from BPMN models deployed to a Camunda engine. RPA bots can be orchestrated as External Tasks using the Camunda Modeler and Cawemo.

For detailed instructions on how to connect your first RPA bot to a BPMN model (using Cawemo and the Camunda Modeler) and execute it from a running process instance using the Camunda engine, head over to our [installation guide]({{< ref "/installation/camunda-bpm-rpa-bridge.md" >}}) or the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/rpa).

# The Basics

## What is the Camunda Platform RPA Bridge?

The Camunda RPA Bridge serves as a connector between Camunda (BPMN) on the one side and a vendor for RPA bots on the other side. For an overview about what RPA vendors and which versions are supported, please consult the [Supported Environments]({{< ref "#prerequisites-and-supported-environments" >}}) section.

Processes running inside the Camunda engine can define external tasks marked as RPA tasks. The bridge extends the regular [Java External Task Client](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/clients/java), fetches, and locks the RPA tasks, and starts an RPA bot in one of the [supported RPA vendors]({{< ref "#prerequisites-and-supported-environments" >}}). Once the bot is executed, the Camunda RPA Bridge fetches the result (output variables) and state (success/failure) of the bot. It completes the previously locked external task while passing any result variables received from the bot to the Camunda engine.

## How to use this Guide?

The bridge is a powerful tool that can work in many scenarios and connect to different RPA solutions. This guide aims to give a broad overview over the capabilities of the Camunda RPA bridge while also providing detailed information for setups with each RPA vendor.

For each topic this guide covers, you will find general information that apply to all applications of the RPA Bridge. Details for use with a specific RPA vendor or environment are located in sub-sections following the general introduction.

# Prerequisites and Supported Environments
To execute RPA bots from Camunda, you will need:

* Camunda Platform 7.14 Enterprise Edition or later
* Java 8 or later installed on the machine that runs the Camunda RPA Bridge

[UiPath Orchestrator](https://www.uipath.com/product/orchestrator) users can use the bridge with one of the following versions:

* On-Premises v2019 or v2020.4
* Automation Cloud

In terms of [Automation Anywhere](https://www.automationanywhere.com/products/automation-360), the bridge integrates with:

* Automation 360 (formerly A2019)

To design a BPMN model that connects to one or more RPA bots through the bridge, the following tools are beneficial (but not required):

* Cawemo 1.4 or later (to create and distribute worker catalogs) with [Cloud Connect Plugin](https://downloads.camunda.cloud/enterprise-release/cawemo/cloud-connect-modeler-plugin) 3.0.0 or later
* [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler) 4.7 or later (to apply the worker catalog to your process model and add BPMN error capabilities to your RPA tasks)

# Camunda Platform RPA Bridge configuration
The bridge is configurable through the `application.yml` file that is included in the provided archive.

## Configure Logging

The bridge logs basic information on log level `INFO`. Technical exceptions and erroneous states are logged on level `WARN` 
accompanied by the business context (e.g., exception while starting an RPA bot or handling a response from the RPA vendor).
As the bridge is based on Spring Boot, you can consult the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-logging) for further information on logging configurations.

### Logging Categories

To log the bridge's interactions with external systems, you can set the log level of the defined loggers to `DEBUG` by adding the following to the configuration for every logger you want to change, 
replacing `'<Logger>'` with a logger from the list. Please note that loggers work hierarchically, meaning that configuring `org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge` with level `DEBUG` will log statements of logger `org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.uipath` in `DEBUG` as well.

```yaml
...
logging.level.<Logger>: DEBUG
...
```

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Logger</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all interactions with all external systems (i.e. RPA vendor and Camunda Platform Runtime).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.externaltask</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all interactions with the Camunda Platform Runtime, specifically the locking, unlocking, completing and failing of External Tasks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all interactions with all possible RPA vendors, including outgoing and incoming requests as well as responses for outgoing requests.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.RequestHandler</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all responses for outgoing requests to RPA vendors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.uipath</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all interactions with UiPath, specifically outgoing and incoming requests. Note that responses to outgoing request are NOT logged here. Please additionally configure the <code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.RequestHandler</code> for that purpose</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.uipath.auth</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all authentication interactions with UiPath, specifically outgoing requests. Note that responses to outgoing request are NOT logged here.Please additionally configure the <code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.RequestHandler</code> for that purpose</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.aai</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all interactions with Automation Anywhere, specifically outgoing requests. Note that responses to outgoing request are NOT logged here. Please additionally configure the <code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.RequestHandler</code> for that purpose</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.aai.auth</code></td>
    <td>Logs details for all authentication interactions with Automation Anywhere, specifically outgoing requests. Note that responses to outgoing request are NOT logged here.Please additionally configure the <code>org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.rpa.RequestHandler</code> for that purpose</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Log to file

By default, all log output goes to the console. If you would like to log to a file `my.log`, add the following line to the configuration

```yaml
logging.file.name: my.log
```

Please consult the [official Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-logging-file-output) for further options.

# Set up an RPA Task

The RPA bridge is a regular Java external task client and RPA tasks are [external tasks]({{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks.md" >}}) with specific settings.

The bridge listens for tasks with the topics configured in the `application.yml` file. When a process instance reaches an external task with one of these topics, the bridge will fetch and lock them. Once a task is locked, the bridge forwards it to the configured RPA vendor, which will take care of executing the associated robots.

## Map a Task to an RPA Bot

It is necessary to add an [extension property]({{< ref "/reference/bpmn20/custom-extensions/extension-elements.md#properties" >}}) with the name `bot` and a value that references the bot inside the RPA platform to tell the bridge for which RPA process a bot should be started. The different vendors have different ways of referencing RPA bots. Find the details in the table below.

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>RPA vendor name</th>
    <th>Identifier for RPA bot</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>UiPath</td>
    <td>package name of the released process in UiPath</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Automation Anywhere</td>
    <td>name of the RPA bot as assigned when creating the RPA bot</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Using Cawemo and the Camunda Modeler

With Cawemo you can create worker catalogs that define all properties for RPA tasks. Those can be used to populate existing BPMN models with the correct properties and extensions using the Camunda Modeler. Detailed instructions on how to create catalog projects and how to sync them with the Camunda Modeler can be found in the [RPA Getting Started Guide](https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/rpa).

### Manual Setup using the Camunda Modeler

Users can set the extension property using the Camunda Modeler (or any other BPMN or XML editor). In the Modeler, select the task and switch to the Extensions tab in the properties panel. Add a property named `bot` with a value equal to the bot identifier of the configured RPA vendor.

Alternatively, you can use any text editor to create a BPMN file that contains the following XML structure.
This example shows an external task that will trigger the RPA bot `myRobot` and is published in the `RPA` external task topic.

```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="myRPAtask" name="Launch the Robots" camunda:type="external" camunda:topic="RPA">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <camunda:properties>
      <camunda:property name="bot" value="myRobot" />
    </camunda:properties>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```
## Variables

You can send/receive variables to/from an RPA bot by using [input and output mapping]({{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/variables.md#input-output-variable-mapping" >}}) on the external task.
All local variables of the external task will be made available to the RPA bot. In return, all variables that the RPA bot exports will be returned back to the task and should be mapped to a higher scope via output mapping (if the rest of the process should have access to them).
Make sure to define input variables in your RPA bot to access them.

This example shows an external task that uses input mapping to pass three variables to an RPA bot called `PrintReceipt`. If the bot returns a variable called `pdfStorage` it will be mapped to the task's parent scope using output mapping.
The bot might return more variables that are ignored in this case.

```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="myRPAtask" name="GenerateReceipt" camunda:type="external" camunda:topic="RPA">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <camunda:inputOutput>
       <camunda:inputParameter name="productName">${product}</camunda:inputParameter>
       <camunda:inputParameter name="count">${count}</camunda:inputParameter>
       <camunda:inputParameter name="price">${price}</camunda:inputParameter>
       <camunda:outputParameter name="pdfStorage">${pdfStorage}</camunda:outputParameter>
      </camunda:inputOutput>
    <camunda:properties>
      <camunda:property name="bot" value="PrintReceipt" />
    </camunda:properties>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```

It is important to keep in mind that the Camunda engine does not have any control over the RPA bot execution. An RPA bot might return one set of variables if it succeeds and a different set in case of failure.
If you configure output mapping for a variable that returns from the bot you are relying on that bot to always return this variable. If the bot does not return the correct variable, the output mapping will fail with an exception.
To prevent that, you can enable an engine configuration flag called [skipOutputMappingOnCanceledActivities]({{< ref "/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/process-engine.md#skipOutputMappingOnCanceledActivities" >}}). The flag will cause all activities (not only RPA tasks) to skip the output mapping if they are canceled.

### Variable Conversion with UiPath

UiPath supports basic variable types like String (text), Boolean (true/false), Number, and Date/Time, as well as more complex structures like Arrays and Data Tables.

The RPA bridge can convert primitive types (i.e., String, Boolean, Number) and Date/Time variables for Cockpit to typed variables. The complex types are passed as received from UiPath (i.e., JSON String representation).

For more information, please consult the UiPath [documentation page](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/types-of-variables) about the different variable types.

### Variable Conversion with Automation Anywhere

Besides primitive variable types like String (text), Boolean (true/false), and Number, Automation Anywhere supports more complex types like DateTime, List, Dictionary, Table, and Record. Additionally, there are custom types like Credential, File, Form, Session, and Window.

The RPA Bridge can convert primitive types (i.e., String, Boolean, Number) and DateTime variables for Cockpit to typed variables. The complex types are passed as received from Automation Anywhere (i.e., JSON nodes).

Please consult the Automation Anywhere [documentation page](https://docs.automationanywhere.com/bundle/enterprise-v2019/page/enterprise-cloud/topics/aae-client/bot-creator/using-variables/cloud-user-local-variables.html) for more information about the different variable types.

## Error Handling

In case an RPA bot fails for any reason, you might want to react to the failure by throwing a [BPMN error]({{< ref "/reference/bpmn20/events/error-events.md" >}}).
You can do that by adding the [camunda:errorEventDefinition]({{< ref "/reference/bpmn20/custom-extensions/extension-elements.md#erroreventdefinition" >}}) extension element to a service task.

Compared to the `bpmn:errorEventDefinition`, the `camunda:errorEventDefinition` elements accept an additional `expression` attribute which supports any JUEL expression. Within the expression you have access to the `ExternalTaskEntity` object like shown in the example below. For more information about External Task error handling via `camunda:errorEventDefinition` have a look at the [External Tasks Guide]({{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks.md#error-event-definitions" >}}).

You can use this feature regardless of the outcome of the RPA bot. Even if the bot was executed successfully, you could still decide to throw a BPMN error. Also note, that
the RPA bot's variables are available for mapping and error handling via `camunda:errorEventDefinition`, even if the bot failed.

### Examples:

**How do I access the External Task object and match an error message coming from my bot?**

```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="myRPAtask" name="GenerateReceipt" camunda:type="external" camunda:topic="RPA">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <camunda:errorEventDefinition id="myErrorEventDefinition" errorRef="myError" expression="${externalTask.getErrorDetails() == 'myErrorMessage'}" />
    <camunda:properties>
      <camunda:property name="bot" value="PrintReceipt" />
    </camunda:properties>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```

**How can I match a substring?**

Note that if multiple errorEventDefinitions are provided, the first one that evaluates to true will trigger the referenced error. In this example `myErrorEventDefinition1` and `myErrorEventDefinition2` will trigger the same error while `myErrorEventDefinition3` will trigger a different one:

```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="myRPAtask" name="GenerateReceipt" camunda:type="external" camunda:topic="RPA">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <camunda:errorEventDefinition id="myErrorEventDefinition1" errorRef="myError" expression="${myStringVar.startsWith('foo'}" />
    <camunda:errorEventDefinition id="myErrorEventDefinition2" errorRef="myError" expression="${myStringVar.endsWith('bar'}" />
    <camunda:errorEventDefinition id="myErrorEventDefinition3" errorRef="myError2" expression="${myStringVar.contains('baz'}" />
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```
