The Camunda DMN engine is a Java library which can evaluate DMN decision tables.
It implements the following versions of the OMG standard:

* [DMN 1.3] to the extent documented in the [DMN reference]
* [DMN 1.2] limited to the implemented feature set of DMN 1.3, i.e. features that are new in DMN 1.2 are not implemented yet

The DMN engine can be used as library embedded in an
application or in combination with the Camunda BPM platform. This section
covers how to embed the library and use it to evaluate decisions. For more
information on the integration in the Camunda BPM platform, please see the
[corresponding section][platform]. You can read more about the DMN 1.3 standard
in the [DMN reference].

A complete example how to embed the decision engine and test
decisions can be found on [GitHub].
