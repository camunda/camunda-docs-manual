The user operation log contains entries for many API operations and can be used for auditing purposes. It provides data on what kind of operations are performed as well as details on the changes involved in the operation. Operations are logged when the operation is performed in the context of a logged in user. To use the operation log, the process engine history level must be set to `FULL`.

## Write log entries regardless of user authentication context

If it is desired that operations are logged regardless whether they are performed in the context of a logged in user or not, then the process engine configuration flag named `restrictUserOperationLogToAuthenticatedUsers` can be set to `false`.

## Access the user operation log

The user operation log can be accessed via the Java API. The history service can be used to execute a `UserOperationLogQuery` by calling `historyService.createUserOperationLogQuery().execute()`. The query can be restricted with various filtering options. The query is also {{< restref page="queryUserOperationEntries" text="exposed in the REST API" tag="Historic-User-Operation-Log" >}}.


## User operation log entries

The log consists of *operations* and *entries*. An operation corresponds to one performed action and consists of multiple entries, at least one. Entries contain the detailed changes being part of the operation. When making a user operation log query, the returned entities are of type `UserOperationLogEntry`, corresponding to entries. All entries of one operation are linked by an operation id.

A user operation log entry has the following properties:

* **Operation ID**: A generated id that uniquely identifies a performed operation. Multiple log entries that are part of one operation reference the same operation ID.
* **Operation Type**: The name of the performed operation. Available operation types are listed in the interface {{< javadocref page="org/camunda/bpm/engine/history/UserOperationLogEntry.html" text="org.camunda.bpm.engine.history.UserOperationLogEntry" >}}. Note that one operation can consist of multiple types, for example a cascading API operation is one user operation, but is split into multiple types of operations.
* **Entity Type**: An identifier of the type of the entity that was addressed by the operation. Available entity types are listed in the class {{< javadocref page="org/camunda/bpm/engine/EntityTypes.html" text="org.camunda.bpm.engine.EntityTypes" >}}. Like the operation type, one operation may address more than one type of entity.
* **Category**: The name of the category the operation is associated with. Available categories are listed in the interface {{< javadocref page="org/camunda/bpm/engine/history/UserOperationLogEntry.html" text="org.camunda.bpm.engine.history.UserOperationLogEntry" >}}. For example, all task related runtime operations like claiming and completing tasks fall into the category {{< javadocref page="org/camunda/bpm/engine/history/UserOperationLogEntry.html#CATEGORY_TASK_WORKER" text="TaskWorker" >}}.
* **Annotation**: An arbitrary text annotation set by a user for auditing reasons. Multiple log entries that belong to an operation have the same annotation.
* **Entity IDs**: A job log entry contains the entity IDs that serve to identify the entities addressed by the operation. For example, an operation log entry on a task contains the id of the task as well as the id of the process instance the task belongs to. As a second example, a log entry for suspending all process instances of a process definition does not contain individual process instance IDs but only the process definition ID.
* **User ID**: The ID of the user who performed the operation.
* **Timestamp**: The time at which the operation was performed.
* **Changed Property**: A user operation may change multiple properties. For example, suspension of a process instance changes the suspension state property. A log entry is created for each changed property involved in an operation.
* **Old Property Value**: The previous value of the changed property. A  `null` value either indicates that the property was previously `null` or is not known.
* **New Property Value**: The new value of the changed property.

## Annotation of user operation logs

User Operation Logs are helpful to audit manual operations. To make it obvious why a certain 
operation was performed, sometimes it is not enough to only log technical information (e. g. 
timestamp, operation type, etc.) but also add an annotation that puts the operation in the right 
business context.

You can directly pass an annotation for the following operations:

* [Process Instance Modification][op-log-set-annotation-instance-mod]

You can also set an annotation to an operation log which is already present:

An annotation can be set and cleared via Java API:

```java
String operationId = historyService.createUserOperationLogQuery()
    .singleResult()
    .getOperationId();

String annotation = "Instances restarted due to wrong turn";
historyService.setAnnotationForOperationLogById(operationId, annotation);

historyService.clearAnnotationForOperationLogById(operationId);
```

**Please note:** Annotations are present on all entries that belong to an operation log.

Please also see the REST API reference for {{< restref page="setAnnotationUserOperationLog" text="setting" tag="Historic-User-Operation-Log" >}} and 
{{< restref page="clearAnnotationUserOperationLog" text="clearing" tag="Historic-User-Operation-Log" >}} annotations.
