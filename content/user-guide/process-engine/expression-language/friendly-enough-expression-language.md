â€‹The Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) is specified within the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard by the Object Management Group (OMG). FEEL has the following features:

- Side-effect free
- Simple data model with numbers, dates, strings, lists, and contexts
- Simple syntax designed for a wide audience
- Three-valued logic (true, false, null) based on SQL and PMML

See the [official specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.0/PDF).


Within Camunda 7, FEEL can be used in many circumstances to evaluate small script-like expressions. The following table provides an overview of the BPMN elements which support usage of FEEL.

<table class="table desc-table">

          Different Elements
        </a>
    </td>
    <td>Expression language as the value of an attribute or element</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/the-job-executor.md#specifying-priorities-in-bpmn-xml" >}}">

    </td>
    <td>Expression language to determine the priority of a job</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In contrast to the [Unified Expression Language]({{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/expression-language/unified-expression-language.md" >}}) FEEL does not support `Expression language as delegation code` and does not provide access to beans and Internal Context Variables. This steams from FEEL's nature of being Side-effect free.

# Usage of Expression Language

## Conditions

To use conditional sequence flows or conditional events, expression language is usually used.
For conditional sequence flows, a `conditionExpression` element of a sequence flow has to be used.
For conditional events, a `condition` element of a conditional event has to be used. Both are
of the type `tFormalExpression`. The text content of the element is the expression to be evaluated.

Within the expression, the execution variables are available.

The following example shows usage of expression language as condition of a sequence flow:

```xml
  <sequenceFlow>
    <conditionExpression xsi:type="tFormalExpression"  language="feel">
      test == 'foo'
    </conditionExpression>
  </sequenceFlow>
```

For usage of expression language on conditional events, see the following example:

```xml
<conditionalEventDefinition>
  <condition type="tFormalExpression">var1 == 1</condition language="feel">
</conditionalEventDefinition>
```


## inputOutput Parameters

With the Camunda `inputOutput` extension element you can map an `inputParameter` or `outputParameter`
with expression language.

For usage of expression language on `inputParameter` mapping, see the following example:

```xml
  <serviceTask id="task" camunda:class="org.camunda.bpm.example.SumDelegate">
    <extensionElements>
      <camunda:inputOutput>
        <camunda:inputParameter name="x">
          var1 + var2
        </camunda:inputParameter>
      </camunda:inputOutput>
    </extensionElements>
  </serviceTask>
```

## Value

Different BPMN and CMMN elements allow to specify their content or an attribute value by an
expression. Please see the corresponding sections for [BPMN][] and [CMMN][] in the references
for more detailed examples.


# Availability of Variables and Functions Inside Expression Language

## Process Variables

A conditional sequence flow can directly check a variable value:

```xml
  <sequenceFlow>
    <conditionExpression xsi:type="tFormalExpression">
      ${test == 'start'}
    </conditionExpression>
  </sequenceFlow>
```
The list of variable types that is supported by FEEL can be found in the <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/dmn-engine/feel/type-handling.md" >}}">FEEL Engine Type Handling</a> page.

## Custom Functions
Camunda 7 provides a wrapper for the FEEL Scala Engine to implement Custom Functions, which can be 
called in expressions and unary tests.
