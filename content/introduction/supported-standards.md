Camunda supports three different standards in the Business Process Management scope: BPMN 2.0, CMMN 1.1 and DMN 1.1.
These three standards are defined by the [Object Management Group][OMG] with active collaboration of Camunda.

Camunda BPM provides open source implementations of execution and [modeling tools][modelers].
