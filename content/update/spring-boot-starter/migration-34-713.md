# New version handling

Starting with version 7.13.0, Camunda 7 and its compatible Camunda Spring Boot Starter artifact will share the same version.
All adjustments in the Spring Boot Starter will now be covered in the general migration guide, i.e. the [7.12 to 7.13 guide]({{< ref "/update/minor/712-to-713/_index.md#spring-boot-starter-update" >}}).
