# Tasklist translations

With Camunda Platform 7.7, some Tasklist translations have changed.

The previously called `LESS_VARIABLES` and `MORE_VARIABLES` [have been renamed](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-tasklist-translations/commit/56445f8c4439d7c580e7a8bdfcdad1982169e1bb) to `SHOW_LESS` and `SHOW_MORE`.
