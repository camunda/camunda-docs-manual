This guide covers mandatory migration steps and optional considerations for the initial configuration of new functionality included in Camunda 7.22.

# Database updates

Every Camunda installation requires a database schema update. Check our [database schema update guide]({{< ref "/installation/database-schema.md#update" >}})
for further instructions.

# Full distribution

This section is applicable if you installed the
[Full Distribution]({{< ref "/introduction/downloading-camunda.md#full-distribution" >}})
with a **shared process engine**.

The following steps are required:

1. Update the Camunda libraries and applications inside the application server.
2. Migrate custom process applications.

Before starting, ensure you have downloaded the Camunda 7.22 distribution for the application server you use. This contains the SQL scripts and libraries required for the update. This guide assumes you have unpacked the distribution to a path named `$DISTRIBUTION_PATH`.

# Camunda Spin
 We’ve moved the `camunda-spin` project from its [previous location](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-spin) into the [mono repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform). We’re no longer versioning it independently. Instead, we’ve integrated it into the 7.X.Y versioning scheme, so you can conveniently declare Camunda `7.22.0-alpha1` to use the latest release of Camunda Spin. 

# Camunda Commons
 We’ve moved the `camunda-commons` project from its [previous location](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-commons) into the [mono repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform). We’re no longer versioning it independently. Instead, we’ve integrated it into the 7.X.Y versioning scheme, so you can conveniently declare Camunda `7.22.0-alpha1` to use the latest release of Camunda Commons.
 We've also updated the `camunda-commons-bom` to include `camunda-commons-typed-values`. Now, you can manage all Camunda commons dependency versions directly through the `camunda-commons-bom`.

# Camunda Template Engines FreeMarker
 We’ve moved the `camunda-template-engines-freemarker` project from its [previous location](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-template-engines-jsr223) into the [mono repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform). We’re no longer versioning it independently. Instead, we’ve integrated it into the 7.X.Y versioning scheme, so you can conveniently declare Camunda `7.22.0-alpha2` to use the latest release of Camunda Template Engines FreeMarker.

# Camunda Connect
 We’ve moved the `camunda-connect` project from its [previous location](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-connect) into the [mono repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform). We’re no longer versioning it independently. Instead, we’ve integrated it into the 7.X.Y versioning scheme, so you can conveniently declare Camunda `7.22.0-alpha2` to use the latest release of Camunda Connect.
 
# Camunda Connect dependency removed from `camunda-engine`

`camunda-connect` is no longer dependency to `camunda-engine` and respectively in pre-packaged distributions (Tomcat, WildFly).
 If you use Camunda Connect functionality, check if you need to re-introduce the following dependencies to your project:

* `camunda-connect-core`
* `camunda-connect-connectors-all`
* `camunda-connect-http-client`
* `camunda-connect-soap-http-client`

# Update to JBoss EAP 8

With this release, we support JBoss EAP 8.0, it's Jakarta EE compliant platform. The artifacts are shipped with the latest pre-packaged [Camunda 7 WildFly distribution]({{< ref "/installation/full/jboss/manual.md#setup" >}}).
If you prefer to stay on JBoss EAP 7, you can still download the Java EE compliant [modules][wildfly26-modules], [web application][wildfly26-webapp], and [REST API][wildfly26-rest-api]. 

To work with JBoss EAP 8, consider the following when migrating your process applications and replacing artifacts on the application server:

[wildfly26-modules]: https://artifacts.camunda.com/artifactory/camunda-bpm/org/camunda/bpm/wildfly/camunda-wildfly26-modules/
[wildfly26-webapp]: https://artifacts.camunda.com/artifactory/camunda-bpm/org/camunda/bpm/webapp/camunda-webapp-jboss/
[wildfly26-rest-api]: https://artifacts.camunda.com/artifactory/public/org/camunda/bpm/camunda-engine-rest/

## Migrate process applications

* Replace Java EE class references (`javax.*`) with Jakarta class references (`jakarta.*`)
  * You might have a look at [`org.eclipse.transformer:transformer-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/eclipse/transformer)
* Replace Camunda class references:
  * `org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.EjbProcessApplication` → `org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.JakartaEjbProcessApplication`
  * `org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.ServletProcessApplicationDeployer` → `org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.JakartaServletProcessApplicationDeployer`
  * `org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.ServletProcessApplication` → `org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.JakartaServletProcessApplication`
  * `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.jta.JtaTransactionContext` → `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.jta.JakartaTransactionContext`
  * `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.jta.JtaTransactionContextFactory` → `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.jta.JakartaTransactionContextFactory`
  * `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.JtaProcessEngineConfiguration` → `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.JakartaTransactionProcessEngineConfiguration`
  * `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.interceptor.JtaTransactionInterceptor` → `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.interceptor.JakartaTransactionInterceptor`
* Replace Camunda Maven dependencies:
  * `org.camunda.bpm.javaee:camunda-ejb-client` → `org.camunda.bpm.javaee:camunda-ejb-client-jakarta`
  * `org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine-cdi` → `org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine-cdi-jakarta`

## Replace artifacts on the application server

You can find the new artifacts either in the current WildFly distribution or in the [`camunda-wildfly-modules`](https://artifacts.camunda.com/artifactory/camunda-bpm/org/camunda/bpm/wildfly/camunda-wildfly-modules/).

### Replace modules

* `$WILDFLY_HOME/modules/org/camunda/spin/camunda-spin-dataformat-xml-dom` → `$WILDFLY_HOME/modules/org/camunda/spin/camunda-spin-dataformat-xml-dom-jakarta`
* Camunda WildFly Subsystem under `$JBOSS_HOME/modules/org/camunda/bpm/$APP_SERVER/camunda-wildfly-subsystem`
  
### Replace web application (Cockpit, Admin, Tasklist, Welcome) deployment

Replace the artifact `camunda-webapp-jboss-$PLATFORM_VERSION.war` with `camunda-webapp-wildfly-$PLATFORM_VERSION.war` under `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments`.

### Replace REST API deployment

Replace the artifact `camunda-engine-rest-$PLATFORM_VERSION-wildfly.war` with `camunda-engine-rest-jakarta-$PLATFORM_VERSION-wildfly.war` under `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments`.

# Update to Tomcat 10 Server

This version brings support for `Tomcat 10.1`. A few reasons to upgrade are:

* Namespace Change: Switch from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` for future compatibility.
* Enhanced Security: Improved security features and fixes.
* Modern Features: Supports `Servlet 6.0`, `JSP 3.1`, and `WebSocket 2.1`.
* Performance Improvements: Faster response times and better resource efficiency.
* Simplified Migration: Tools and documentation for easier transition from earlier versions.
* Better Integration: Enhanced compatibility with `Jakarta EE` components and third-party libraries.

From now on, our pre-packaged Tomcat distribution is built with `Tomcat 10.1`.
Additionally, the Tomcat Docker image will, from now on, utilize `Tomcat 10.1`.

If you prefer to stay on `Tomcat 9`, you can still download the `Java EE` compliant [web application][tomcat9-webapp], and [REST API][tomcat9-rest-api].

To work with `Tomcat 10`, consider the following when migrating your process applications and replacing artifacts on the application server:

[tomcat9-webapp]: https://artifacts.camunda.com/ui/native/camunda-bpm/org/camunda/bpm/webapp/camunda-webapp-tomcat/
[tomcat9-rest-api]: https://artifacts.camunda.com/artifactory/public/org/camunda/bpm/camunda-engine-rest/

## Migrate process applications

* Replace Java EE class references (`javax.*`) with Jakarta class references (`jakarta.*`)

 * `org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine-cdi` → `org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine-cdi-jakarta`

## Migrate Java webapp plugins

Replace Java EE class references (`javax.*`) with Jakarta class references (`jakarta.*`)

## Replace web application (Cockpit, Admin, Tasklist, Welcome) deployment

Replace the artifact `camunda-webapp-tomcat-$PLATFORM_VERSION.war` with `camunda-webapp-tomcat-jakarta-$PLATFORM_VERSION.war` under `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps`.

## Replace REST API deployment

Replace the artifact `camunda-engine-rest-$PLATFORM_VERSION-tomcat.war` with `camunda-engine-rest-jakarta-$PLATFORM_VERSION-tomcat.war` under `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps`.

## Migrating to the Tomcat 10 Docker Image

If your application uses a Docker image based on `Tomcat 9`, you need to perform the above migration steps yourself before your application is compatible with the `jakarta` namespace changes the new Tomcat version introduces.

If your application uses a Docker image based on `Tomcat 9`, you need to perform the above migration steps yourself before your application is compatible with the `jakarta` namespace changes the new Tomcat version introduces.

### Weld Class Loading Issues

In deployment scenarios involving one or more process applications with managed beans, classloading issues may occur if the WELD library is directly embedded in the WAR's `/WEB-INF/lib` folder.
To resolve this, move the weld library away from the war and place it into the `$CATALINA_HOME/lib` folder.

The above workaround is not guaranteed to work for cases with bean references between WAR deployments (WAR A referencing a bean from WAR B).

The following test scenarios fail on Tomcat 10:

* [CallActivityContextSwitchTest](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/f37877b822dabcbf3cee5806bd5833d18cdcb543/qa/integration-tests-engine/src/test/java/org/camunda/bpm/integrationtest/functional/context/CallActivityContextSwitchTest.java)
* [CdiBeanCallActivityResolutionTest](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/f37877b822dabcbf3cee5806bd5833d18cdcb543/qa/integration-tests-engine/src/test/java/org/camunda/bpm/integrationtest/functional/cdi/CdiBeanCallActivityResolutionTest.java)

# Camunda Run and Swagger Update

Swagger UI was included in Camunda Run distros for a long time. Unfortunately, maintaining Swagger for Run was a lot of work. Other tools (like Postman or Swagger Editor) provide the same functionality outside of Camunda run. That is why we decided to discontinue Swagger in `camunda-run` to reduce maintenance efforts.

From now on, the `--swaggerui` argument is not available for Camunda Run start scripts, and the Swagger artifacts are not included in the Camunda Run distros anymore.
Instead, you can always use [open-api][open-api] in conjunction with a `REST` client of your choice such as POSTMAN to achieve similar results. 

[open-api]: {{< ref "/reference/rest/openapi/_index.md" >}}

# Update to Groovy 4

We have updated the Groovy version from `2.4` to `4.0`.

## Migrate your scripts

To continue running your Groovy scripts in the Camunda Engine, please read and act on the following release notes, especially the breaking changes:

- [Groovy 2.5](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-2.5.html#Groovy2.5releasenotes-Breakingchanges)
- [Groovy 3.0](http://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#Groovy3.0releasenotes-OtherBreaking)
- [Groovy 4.0](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html#Groovy4.0-breaking)

To make the migration process easier, we have included the `groovy-dateutil` and `groovy-datetime` libraries in the Camunda Platform release. `groovy-dateutil` contains the extension methods for the `java.util.Date` class, while `groovy-datetime` allows using operator overloading, closures, and Groovy's dynamic methods on `java.time`.

## What if I can't migrate my scripts?

It is possible to keep using Camunda Platform with a lower version of Groovy if GROOVY-VERSION is the desired version.

### If using a full distribution of Camunda:

- Remove `groovy-dateutil-4.0.x.jar` and `groovy-datetime-4.0.x.jar`.
- Replace `groovy-4.0.x.jar`, `groovy-json-4.0.x.jar`, `groovy-xml-4.0.x.jar`, and `groovy-templates-4.0.x.jar` libraries with `groovy-{GROOVY-VERSION}.jar`, `groovy-json-{GROOVY-VERSION}.jar`, `groovy-xml-{GROOVY-VERSION}.jar`, and `groovy-templates-{GROOVY-VERSION}.jar`.

### If using Embedded Engine:

- You can keep using your Groovy version without any extra effort.

# Sending telemetry feature removed

Sending telemetry data has been introduced in Camunda `7.14.0+` (and `7.13.7`, `7.12.12`, `7.11.19`)
 and removed in Camunda `7.22.0`. The public API is marked as deprecated and emptied out.
 The telemetry reporter and scheduled timer and all related process engine configuration properties are removed.
 The [diagnostic data][] is still being collected but not sent by any mean.
  You can decide to share it with Camunda if requested in tickets or use it for your diagnostic purposes.

In previous Camunda versions - `7.21.0+`, `7.20.8+`, `7.19.15+`, reporting telemetry data is disabled by default.

[diagnostic data]: {{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/diagnostics-data.md" >}}

## Configuration properties removed

To clean up and refactor our source code, the following process engine configuration properties have been removed.
Please remove all of the occurrences of those properties, regardless of the setup that you are using
(share or embedded process engine, pre-packaged or other distribution).
You need to remove the properties from your tests as well.

* `initializeTelemetry       `
* `telemetryReporterActivate `
* `telemetryReportingPeriod  `
* `telemetryReporterActivate `
* `telemetryRequestRetries   `
* `telemetryRequestTimeout   `

## Public API deprecation

The public API for configuring telemetry and fetching the telemetry configuration have been emptied out and marked as deprecated. 
We recommend to remove the usage of the following API as the endpoints no longer do anything and their usage is unnecessary.

* Java API
  * [`ManagementService#isTelemetryEnabled()`](https://docs.camunda.org/javadoc/camunda-bpm-platform/7.22/org/camunda/bpm/engine/ManagementService.html#isTelemetryEnabled()) (always returns `false`)
  * [`ManagementService#toggleTelemetry(boolean)`](https://docs.camunda.org/javadoc/camunda-bpm-platform/7.22/org/camunda/bpm/engine/ManagementService.html#toggleTelemetry(boolean))
* REST API
  * [Fetch Telemetry Configuration](https://docs.camunda.org/rest/camunda-bpm-platform/7.22/#tag/Telemetry/operation/getTelemetryConfiguration) (always returns `false`)
  * [Configure Telemetry](https://docs.camunda.org/rest/camunda-bpm-platform/7.22/#tag/Telemetry/operation/configureTelemetry)

# Database transaction isolation level `READ_COMMITTED` is enforced

When starting the engine, a check is performed in order to determine if the transaction isolation level set for the database is different from the recommended one `READ_COMMITTED`. If it is, an exception will be thrown.

This behaviour can be disabled by setting the `skipIsolationLevelCheck` flag to `true`. Doing this will prevent an exception from being thrown and a warning message will be logged instead.

[See here]({{< ref "/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/process-engine.md#configuration-properties" >}}) for more details about this and other properties.

# Quarkus 3.15 Extension Update

The Camunda Quarkus Extension has been updated to use Quarkus `3.15`. This  version brings its own features and changes.
For a complete list, see the [Quarkus 3.15 LTS Release](https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-15-1-released) blog post.

## Breaking Changes

`Quarkus 3.15` and previous versions extensions introduce **breaking changes** in the way the Quarkus runtime treats configuration.

A configuration migration is required to remain consistent with the new behavior of the framework (see [property examples](#property-examples) below).

The config properties now follow a similar scheme to the [Camunda Spring Boot Starter Configuration]({{< ref "/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/configuration.md#generic-properties" >}}).

The change affects the configuration of the [process engine]({{< ref "/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/process-engine.md#configuration-properties" >}}) and the [job executor]({{< ref "/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/job-executor.md" >}}).

**Reason for Change**: The Quarkus migration guide encourages using named `ConfigMappings`, and we chose to adopt it to future-proof the extension.
This requires using the new namespace `generic-config`.

- `quarkus.camunda.enforce-history-time-to-live` **becomes** `quarkus.camunda.generic-config.enforce-history-time-to-live`

- `quarkus.camunda.dmn-enabled` **becomes** `quarkus.camunda.generic-config.dmn-enabled`

- **Non-generic** properties such as `quarkus.camunda.job-executor.thread-pool.max-pool-size` remain the same.

For a detailed guide on the new Quarkus properties, visit the updated [Quarkus Configuration]({{< ref "/user-guide/quarkus-integration/configuration.md" >}}) page.

To read more on how Quarkus extensions treat configuration differently, see this [Quarkus Migration Guide](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.14#for-extension-developers) and the [Mapping Configuration to Objects Guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/config-mappings).

# Process Instance Modification Filter Changes

The [Process Definition View][process-instance-modification] dialog of Camunda Cockpit has been updated to use the Historic API. With this change, the `start date` filter is now available within the workflow.

[process-instance-modification]: {{< ref "/webapps/cockpit/bpmn/process-instance-modification.md#perform-a-batch-modification" >}}

## Saved Filters are Now Isolated
Filters saved in the Modify Process Instance workflow were previously shared across other pages. With this update, the filters of Modify Process Instance workflow and other pages are isolated and independent of each other.

{{< note title="Heads-up!" class="warning" >}}
After migrating to the new version of Camunda, no saved filters will be available in the Modify Process Instance workflow. Users will need to re-enter and save these filters following the migration. Please notify your users before the migration.
{{< /note >}}

## Edge Cases with Behavioral Changes

- Tokens on Async Tasks: Tokens sitting on an `asyncBefore`/`asyncAfter` task will not yield process instances when using the `activityIdIn` filter, as no history has been produced yet. Filtering here is effectively racing against the job executor. Given the job executor usually processes faster than a user can apply filters, state changes can impact query results. This filter is most applicable for true wait states (e.g., user tasks, external tasks, timers) rather than transaction boundaries.

- Compensation Scenarios: It is no longer possible to retrieve process instances with the `activityIdIn` filter on the subprocess "activity".  When using `activityIdIn` filter for compensation scenarios, users need to filter by specific flow nodes rather than the broader subprocess activities.

- Incident Deletion: When an incident is deleted, the incident filters will still return the process instances that previously had an incident. This behavior aligns with the standalone batch operation page and ensures consistency across the application.
